## clone

```sgr clone [OPTIONS] REMOTE_REPOSITORY [LOCAL_REPOSITORY]```

Clone a remote Splitgraph repository into a local one.

The lookup path for the repository is governed by the ``SG_REPO_LOOKUP`` and ``SG_REPO_LOOKUP_OVERRIDE``
config parameters and can be overriden by the command line ``--remote`` option.

### Options

  * **`-r, --remote TEXT`**: Alias or full connection string for the remote engine
  * **`-d, --download-all`**: Download all objects immediately instead on checkout.

## push

```sgr push [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY [REMOTE_REPOSITORY]```

Push changes from a local repository to the upstream.

The actual destination is decided as follows:

  * Remote engine: ``remote`` argument (either engine alias as specified in the config or a connection string,
    then the upstream configured for the repository.

  * Remote repository: ``remote_repository`` argument, then the upstream configured for the repository, then
    the same name as the repository.

``-h`` and ``-o`` allow to upload the objects to somewhere else other than the external drivers. Currently,
uploading to an S3-compatible host via Minio is supported: see :mod:`splitgraph.hooks.s3` for information
on handler options and how to register a new upload handler.

### Options

  * **`-r, --remote TEXT`**: Alias or full connection string for the remote engine
  * **`-h, --upload-handler TEXT`**: Upload handler
  * **`-o, --upload-handler-options TEXT`**: Upload handler parameters

## pull

```sgr pull [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY```

Pull changes from an upstream repository.

### Options

  * **`-d, --download-all TEXT`**: Download all objects immediately instead on checkout.

## publish

```sgr publish [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY TAG```

Publish tagged Splitgraph images to the catalog.

Only images with a tag can be published. The image must have been pushed
to the registry beforehand with ``sgr push``.

### Options

  * **`-r, --readme FILENAME`**: 
  * **`--skip-provenance`**: Don't include provenance in the published information.
  * **`--skip-previews`**: Don't include table previews in the published information.

## upstream

```sgr upstream [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY```

Get or set the upstream for a repository.

This shows the default repository used for pushes and pulls as well as allows to change it to a different
remote engine and repository.

The remote engine alias must exist in the config file.

### Examples

``sgr upstream my/repo --set splitgraph.com username/repo``

Sets the upstream for ``my/repo`` to ``username/repo`` existing on the ``splitgraph.com`` engine

``sgr upstream my/repo --reset``

Removes the upstream for ``my/repo``.

``sgr upstream my/repo``

Shows the current upstream for ``my/repo``.

### Options

  * **`-s, --set <TEXT REPOSITORY>...`**: Set the upstream to a engine alias + repository
  * **`-r, --reset`**: Delete the upstream
