# DataGrip

DataGrip can connect to the DDN using the default "Postgres" configuration.

At the moment, introspection does not work on DataGrip, so you will see an empty
tree in the sidebar and an error notification may appear.

You can still run all SQL queries in the editor.

Please see the [DataGrip integration docs](/docs/integrating-splitgraph/datagrip)
for screenshots and more detailed instructions. Note they apply to a local
engine, not the DDN, but they are basically the same.
