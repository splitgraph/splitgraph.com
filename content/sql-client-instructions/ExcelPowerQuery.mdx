# Excel and Power Query via ODBC

You can get DDN data in Excel via Power Query (Get & Transform) using the official PostgreSQL ODBC
driver.

Note that in Office 2016 Professional, 2019 Professional and Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise, you
have access to a direct PostgreSQL import functionality. These instructions use ODBC and are
compatible with more Office versions (including Home/Business Standard and 365 Home/Personal/Business).

See the [compatibility page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/where-is-get-transform-power-query-e9332067-8e49-46fc-97ff-f2e1bfa0cb16?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) for more details.

These instructions have only been tested on Windows.

### Install psqlODBC

Install the PostgreSQL ODBC driver from https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/msi/. Use the latest
available version for your architecture ([`psqlodbc_13_00_0000-x64.zip`](https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/odbc/versions/msi/psqlodbc_13_00_0000-x64.zip) at the time of writing).

### Configure the DDN data source in ODBC

Start &#x2192 Programs &#x2192 Windows Administrative Tools &#x2192 ODBC Data Sources (64-bit)
or run `%windir%\\system32\\odbcad32.exe`.

Click "Create New Data Source" and select "PostgreSQL Unicode (x64)".

Set up the data source as follows:

![Creating PostgreSQL ODBC data source for Excel and Power Query](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/sql-client-instructions/images/excel-odbc-windows-02.png)

  * **Data Source**: ddn (or any preferred name)
  * **Database**: ddn
  * **Server**: data.splitgraph.com
  * **Port**: 5432
  * **User name**: Splitgraph API key
  * **Password**: Splitgraph API secret
  * **SSL Mode**: require

Also make sure to disable "Server side prepare" (Datasource &#x2192 Page 2) since the DDN currently doesn't support prepared statements.

### Import data in Excel

Start Excel, then, in "Data", select "Get Data" &#x2192 "From Other Sources" &#x2192 "From ODBC".

Select the data source name you set up previously. At this stage, you can enter a query that will
immediately load into your spreadsheet.

### Use Power Query to browse the DDN and select a dataset

Alternatively, you can omit entering a custom query, which will take you to the Navigator window. This
will contain a limited sample of Splitgraph datasets that are featured on the DDN or owned by you.

Once you've selected a dataset, you can use normal Power Query tools to prepare it for import.
