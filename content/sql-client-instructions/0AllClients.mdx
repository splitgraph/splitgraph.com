# Most SQL Clients

The Splitgraph "Data Delivery Network" (DDN) is based on the PostgreSQL wire
protocol. Most SQL clients should be able to connect to it and query it.

**Don't have a SQL client?** We recommend [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/). Or, if you have VSCode,
the [SQLTools Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools)
along with its [SQLTools PostgreSQL/Redshift Driver](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools-driver-pg), is a convenient way to get started.

**Introspection:** Some clients send "introspection queries" so they know which tables and schemas
to show you in the workspace. In most cases, these introspection queries are
compatible with Splitgraph, which will return a list of tables in your "workspace"
(currently, any repositories you own, along with a handful of Splitgraph-featured repositories).

**Troubleshooting Introspection**: In some cases, clients may send introspection
queries that Splitgraph does not know how to answer. In this case you should
[file an issue](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/issues/new) with details
of your client.

Other exceptions and quirks of various clients are listed below. This is not
an exhaustive list.
