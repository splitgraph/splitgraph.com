# Metabase

You can set up the Splitgraph DDN in Metabase like any other PostgreSQL connection. Make sure to use SSL and disable prepared statements in the Metabase JDBC parameters (`prepareThreshold=0`).

Data discovery (introspection query interception) only works in Metabase version v0.36.8 or above. Earler versions have an [issue](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/issues/12450) with slashes in schema names
that Splitgraph DDN uses to denote repositories.

Note that there are still some outstanding issues with Metabase X-Rays and automatically generated questions on the DDN. You can still use direct SQL queries, allowing you to reference Splitgraph data in your Metabase dashboards.
