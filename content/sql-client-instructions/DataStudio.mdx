# Google Data Studio

You will need the server's root certificate to set up the connection. You will also need a client certificate pair: this can be self-signed.

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout client.key -x509 -days 365 -out client.crt
```

Note that there's a bug in the Data Studio which means that you have to **upload your key to the client certificate field and the certificate to the key field**.

Data discovery doesn't completely work on Google Data Studio, as it treats all tables as being in the public schema and doesn't schema-qualify them when making queries from the table picker. You can still use a custom query to import data into Google Data Studio.
