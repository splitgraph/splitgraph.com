# Google Data Studio

You will need the server's root certificate to set up the connection. You will also need a client certificate pair: this can be self-signed.

```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout client.key -x509 -days 365 -out client.crt
```

Note that, due to a bug in Data Studio, you must **upload your key to the "certificate"
field, and your certificate to the "key" field**.

Data discovery doesn't completely work on Google Data Studio, as it treats all tables as being in the public schema and doesn't schema-qualify them when making queries from the table picker. You can still use a custom query to import data into Google Data Studio.
