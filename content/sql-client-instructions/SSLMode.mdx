# SSL Mode (e.g. in `psql`)

In some cases your client may require full verification of the certificate
presented by Splitgraph, e.g. with `sslmode=require` or `sslmode=verify-ca`.

You will need to trust the Root CA, and in some cases may need to generate
a self signed cert for yourself. More details are available at the [DDN docs](https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/data-delivery-network#ssl-encryption-and-server-certificate).

You can download the Root CA (we use LetsEncrypt) here: [https://www.identrust.com/dst-root-ca-x3](https://www.identrust.com/dst-root-ca-x3).

If you're using `psql`, you can download this file into `~/.postgresql/root.crt` and specify `sslmode=verify-ca` in the connection URI, e.g.:

```bash
psql "postgres://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@data.splitgraph.com:5432/ddn?sslmode=verify-ca"
```

Alternatively, you can specify a folder where to download the root cert, and
include that location in the connection URI, e.g.: download it to
`~/.splitgraph/data.splitgraph` and then connect via:

```bash
psql "postgres://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@data.splitgraph.com:5432/ddn?sslmode=verify-ca&sslrootcert=$HOME/.splitgraph/data.splitgraph.com.crt"
```
