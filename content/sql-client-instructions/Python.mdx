# Python with psycopg2

You can use the [psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/) library to connect to the Data Delivery Network from your Python interpreter or a Jupyter notebook:

```python
import psycopg2

# Your Splitgraph DDN username/password
API_KEY = "API_KEY"
API_SECRET = "API_SECRET"

QUERY = """SELECT candidate_normalized, SUM(votes)::integer AS total_votes
	FROM "splitgraph/2016_election:latest".precinct_results
	WHERE state_postal = 'CA'
	GROUP BY candidate_normalized
	ORDER BY total_votes DESC
	LIMIT 5
"""

with psycopg2.connect(
    dsn=f"postgresql://{API_KEY}:{API_SECRET}@data.splitgraph.com:5432/ddn?application_name=psycopg2"
) as conn:
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute(QUERY)
        result = cur.fetchall()
        print(result)
```
