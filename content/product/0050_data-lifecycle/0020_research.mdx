Splitgraph lets you work on data with your existing tools whilst also introducing [concepts and
best practices](/product/splitgraph/motivation) from the software engineering discipline.

### Data Versioning

Splitgraph was partially inspired by Git and implements some of Git's most useful functions. You can
[check out](/docs/sgr/image-management-creation/checkout), [commit](/docs/sgr/image-management-creation/commit),
[tag](/docs/sgr/image-management-creation/tag), [push](/docs/sgr/sharing-images/push) and [pull](/docs/sgr/sharing-images/pull) Splitgraph datasets just like you would with Git.

Splitgraph's versioning is implemented on top of the SQL standard. Any existing tool can interact
with a Splitgraph table and benefit from its change tracking capabilities, for example, [dbt](/docs/integrating-splitgraph/dbt), [Jupyter](/docs/integrating-splitgraph/jupyter-notebooks) or
[Metabase](/docs/integrating-splitgraph/metabase)

The [decentralized demo](/docs/getting-started/decentralized-demo) shows the basics of running Git operations on data.

### `sgr` CLI

The [`sgr` command line client](/docs/architecture/sgr-cli) is the easiest way to manipulate data
images and manage your [Splitgraph engine](/docs/architecture/splitgraph-engine). It ships as a
single binary, freeing you from needing to set up a working Python environment, and takes care
of running the Splitgraph engine in Docker with [`sgr engine`](/docs/sgr/engine-management/engine-add) commands.

### Python Library

Splitgraph is partially written in Python, letting it directly integrate with Python's vast data science
ecosystem. You can manipulate Splitgraph images and repositories directly from your Python code
or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook and export Splitgraph data directly to [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames, including using [layered querying](/docs/large-datasets/layered-querying).

See the [Jupyter/scikit-learn](/docs/integrating-splitgraph/jupyter-notebooks) demo for a showcase.
