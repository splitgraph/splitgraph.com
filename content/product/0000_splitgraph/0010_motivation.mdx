The motivation behind building Splitgraph is simple: advancements made in the last decade in software
engineering and operations, as well as existing best practices, are mostly yet to make their way
to data science and data engineering.

There are currently tens of thousands of open-source **off-the-shelf services and libraries** available,
most of them well documented and with clear installation instructions. With Docker, those components can be
packaged into **self-contained images** that can be dropped into any stack with little extra work required.

Instead of server fleets being configured manually, the rise of infrastructure-as-code has meant that
whole clusters are now defined in **version-controlled definition files** and can be provisioned, scaled and reconfigured
automatically.

**Versioning and revision control** is something that every software engineer knows about. Every change
to code is tracked. Software builds are performed on isolated **CI machines**: there's a clear
build process that avoids the "works on my machine" class of problems.

Finally, good tools that implement all of this **enhance existing abstractions without breaking them**.
Any compiler, IDE or editor can benefit from Git, Mercurial or SVN without having to be aware of them.
Any Unix application can be Dockerized and deployed without being recompiled to use Docker version of system calls.

When we started building Splitgraph in 2018, there was nothing around that hit all these points. Things
are beginning to change and a lot of interesting tools are getting released to help data work. However,
we still don't feel like any of them completely satisfy our vision. We list applications and services that
are most similar to Splitgraph on our [Frequently Asked Questions](/docs/getting-started/frequently-asked-questions#why-not-just-use) page.
