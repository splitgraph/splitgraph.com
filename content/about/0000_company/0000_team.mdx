## `phb`

`phb` is a chat bot that has two purposes:

  * Sending "standup request messages" at 9AM every morning, giving each team member a configurable
    amount of time to respond. PHB also keeps track of the streak of standup messages that were
    sent on time. If the streak is broken, there are precisely no consequences.
  * Picking a question from the [1-on-1 meeting question bank](https://github.com/VGraupera/1on1-questions) and sending it to the team chat, targeting a specific team member. This happens at random intervals defined by the [exponential distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution), often at night, and offers a true clueless middle management experience.

`phb` refused to provide biographical details when asked.
