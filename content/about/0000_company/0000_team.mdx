_Founder_

Started programming in BASIC in 2004 and never stopped (but moved on to different languages). Holds a degree in
Computer Science from the University of Cambridge. Before starting Splitgraph, worked at Man AHL, a quant hedge fund.
At AHL, participated in multiple parts of the business &mdash; from helping maintain Arctic, an open-source high
performance timeseries store, and working on various market data pipelines to doing research on equities and interest
rate / energy derivatives. This experience of working closely with producers, maintainers and consumers of data
has inspired a large amount of Splitgraph's philosophy.

In 2018, accidentally [invented a Morrowind speedrun category](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/06/solving-the-travelling-murderer-problem-of-morrowinds-leader-of-every-faction-speedrun/).

_Founder_

Started programming in PHP in 2004 and definitely stopped. Now prefers TypeScript and
well-written shell scripts. Graduated from Yale University with a BA in Computer
Science  (senior thesis: [TorCoin, a proof-of-bandwidth cryptocurrency](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5639166646753502991)).
In college, started a company selling proxy servers. After college, co-founded
a social app startup. Most recently, was working remotely (before it was cool) as a
software consultant and saw first-hand the pain of data integrations. Traveled and
lived all over the world, most recently in Cambridge and NYC.

Can be found complaining about Big Cloud in HN comments, or out for a run.

</Box>

_VP of Engineering_

`phb` is a chat bot that has two purposes:

- Sending "standup request messages" at 9AM every morning, giving each team member a configurable
  amount of time to respond. PHB also keeps track of the streak of standup messages that were
  sent on time. If the streak is broken, there are precisely no consequences.
- Picking a question from the [1-on-1 meeting question bank](https://github.com/VGraupera/1on1-questions) and sending it to the team chat, targeting a specific team member. This happens at random intervals defined by the [exponential distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution), often at night, and offers a true clueless middle management experience.

`phb` refused to provide biographical details when asked.

_Permanent Intern_

`wildbyte` is mildbyte's alter ego and serves multiple purposes:

- Awarding fellow employees for creative memes in chat
- Sourcing relevant HN comments, but improving them via its markov brain
- Interjecting into the conversation with Patrick Bateman quotes and advice from wallstreetbets
- Running interactive games of Zork (1, 2, or 3)

When asked for biographical details, `wildbyte` asked us if we saw the Patty Winters show this morning.
