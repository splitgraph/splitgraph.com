## Artjoms IÅ¡kovs
_Founder_

Started programming in BASIC in 2004 and never stopped (but moved on to different languages). Holds a degree in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge. Before starting Splitgraph, worked at Man AHL, a quant hedge fund. At AHL, participated in multiple parts of the business &mdash; from helping maintain Arctic, an open-source high performance timeseries store, and working on various market data pipelines to doing research on equities and interest rate / energy derivatives. This experience of working close with producers, maintainers and consumers of data has inspired a large amount of Splitgraph's philosophy.

In 2018, accidentally [invented a Morrowind speedrun category](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/06/solving-the-travelling-murderer-problem-of-morrowinds-leader-of-every-faction-speedrun/).

## PHB
_VP of Engineering_

`phb` is a chat bot that has two purposes:

  * Sending "standup request messages" at 9AM every morning, giving each team member a configurable
    amount of time to respond. PHB also keeps track of the streak of standup messages that were
    sent on time. If the streak is broken, there are precisely no consequences.
  * Picking a question from the [1-on-1 meeting question bank](https://github.com/VGraupera/1on1-questions) and sending it to the team chat, targeting a specific team member. This happens at random intervals defined by the [exponential distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution), often at night, and offers a true clueless middle management experience.

`phb` refused to provide biographical details when asked.
