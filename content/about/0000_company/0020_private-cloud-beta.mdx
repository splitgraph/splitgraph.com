## What we're building

We are developing a "Splitgraph Private Cloud" product, where you can setup your
own private Splitgraph cluster, managed by us and deployed to the cloud region of
your choice.

You can think of the public Splitgraph.com as a demo of this product. Except,
instead of proxying to public datasets, the private cloud can proxy to your
own internal data sources. We can write plugins for warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift...),
databases (Postgres, Mongo, MySQL...), and SaaS services (Snowflake, Stripe, Segment ...).

Each upstream plugin will implement introspection (for the catalog)
and query forwarding (for the SQL endpoint). Ultimately, we're building a
no-code solution where users can connect an upstream data source to Splitgraph and add
services on top of it.

The software will automatically introspect the data source and make
it discoverable in the catalog. And users can query the new
upstream along with all their other data, at the single SQL endpoint.

In the future, we envision this endpoint becoming a universal SQL
firewall/proxy/cache. For each upstream, users will be able to configure services
like caching, SQL firewalling, access control, query rewriting, data masking, versioned
snapshotting, etc.

Ultimately we hope Splitgraph can benefit a number of use cases:

- **Data consumers** will be able to seamlessly run queries across different data silos and enrich private data with public.
- **Vendors** will be able to deliver datasets by making them available over the Splitgraph DDN instead of maintaining pages of instructions on ingesting their data dumps.
- **Data engineers** will be able to simplify their ETL pipelines by working against a single protocol.
- **Administrators** will be able to enforce granular access policies, for example, firewalling queries on columns that a user isn't authorized to see, even if the upstream data warehouse doesn't support that.

## How to get access

We're seeking a small group of early customers to join the beta program of
"Splitgraph Private Cloud." As part of the program, you will have a chance to give your
input on prioritization of upstream plugins and give feedback on early iterations.

If you think Splitgraph can help your business, please get in touch.

Email us at `support@splitgraph.com` with "Private Cloud" in the subject line.
