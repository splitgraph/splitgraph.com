## Data we collect

### Categories of personal information

"User Personal Information" is any personal information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify them. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.” User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.

"Technical Information" may include information we collect from website browsers, such as web server logs, or other log information, such as User session or activity logs. Technical Information may be connected to User Personal Information such as a username or an email address, or to other potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our website and service.

### Information from users with accounts

If you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email address. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information."

### Information from website browsers

If you're just browsing the website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) and web server logs, to collect Technical Information. We collect this from everybody, whether they have an account or not.

The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

### Information from the `sgr` client

When you use the `sgr` client to publish Splitgraph datasets to the Splitgraph Registry,
you are communicating with the Splitgraph Registry over the Splitgraph SQL API. We collect
Technical Information about the API calls that are made by the client, including your API token,
time of the call and the identifier of the repository that was accessed. This information is used
to analyze and improve our SQL API.

We do not collect any telemetry or other information when you're using the `sgr` client without
interacting with the Splitgraph Registry.

## Third-party data processors

We share some data with the following services:

  * Sendgrid (email services)

## Changes to our Privacy Policy

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Splitgraph may change our Privacy Statement from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Policy through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending email to the primary email address specified in your Splitgraph account.
