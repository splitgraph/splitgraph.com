## Pushing data to other engines

Like Git, Splitgraph allows sharing datasets with other Splitgraph engines in a decentralized
fashion. The [two-engine example](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/push-to-other-engine)
showcases pushing data between two engines linked together with docker-compose.

## Publishing data on Splitgraph Cloud

If you're interesting in pushing your dataset to the Splitgraph registry, please follow the
[Splitgraph Cloud guide](../splitgraph-cloud/introduction).

## Merging changes and pull requests

Splitgraph does not currently support merging changes and pull requests.
Instead, it assumes images are immutable and on push, it uploads all images
that do not exist on the remote engine. You can optionally overwrite image tags
that already exist, or push/pull only a single image.

We have found that pull requests aren't as useful for continuously changing datasets as they are
for code. This is because most workflows involve ingesting data from outside sources (CSV files, scraped
data, other databases) into the dataset, so it's better to apply any changes or patches to the source or
intermediate dataset after it's already been ingested.

In this respect, Splitgraph is closer to Docker than to Git. There is no point in submitting a pull
request to a Docker image, as any results will be overwritten the next time the image is built.
Instead, developers propose changes to the code that builds the image. Similarly, Splitgraph supports
the workflow in which developers submit pull requests to the Splitfile that builds the dataset,
allowing proposed changes to persist in future datasets.

You can approximate a workflow similar to pull requests by using tags and forwarding a tag to the
agreed-upon "master" version of the dataset. By default, like Docker, Splitgraph includes a `latest` tag
which is a "floating" tag to the image most recently pushed to its repository.
