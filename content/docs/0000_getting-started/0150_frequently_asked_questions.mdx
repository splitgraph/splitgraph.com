### What is Splitgraph?

Splitgraph is a tool for building, versioning, querying and sharing datasets that works on top of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and integrates seamlessly with anything that uses PostgreSQL.

### Is Splitgraph a PostgreSQL extension?

Not quite. The [Splitgraph engine](../architecture/splitgraph_engine) ships as a Docker image and is a customized version of PostgreSQL that is fully compatible with existing clients. In the future, we might repackage Splitgraph as a PostgreSQL extension.

### Can I add Splitgraph to my existing PostgreSQL deployment?

Whilst it is possible to add Splitgraph to existing PostgreSQL deployments, there isn't currently
a simple installation method. If you're interested in doing so, you can follow the instructions
in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/blob/master/engine/Dockerfile) used
to build the engine or contact us.

You can also add the Splitgraph engine as a PostgreSQL [logical replication client](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/4e78856d3872ddaac8c37df52dc46654a7e0b118/examples/pg-replication),
which will let you ingest data from existing databases without installing Splitgraph on them.

### Why PostgreSQL? Why not write your own database?

PostgreSQL is a battle-tested RDBMS with a mature feature set (ACID transactions, authentication,
indexing, crash safety), a long list of commercial and enthusiast users and a rich ecosystem
of extensions and applications. We don't think that features added by Splitgraph warrant building a brand new database.

Philosophically, we believe that great tools enhance existing abstractions without breaking them:

  * Git adds versioning to the filesystem, enhancing it for any tools that use the filesystem. Compilers,
    IDEs or editors don't need to be aware of Git to reap its benefits.
  * Docker containerizes applications by letting one use the same commands they would use
    for installing the application on a bare machine. The application itself has no idea it's running
    inside of a container and doesn't need to be rewritten to run in Docker.

We were guided by the same principles when building Splitgraph. Any application that works
with PostgreSQL can work with a Splitgraph table without any changes. We have examples of using
Splitgraph with [Jupyter notebooks](../integrating_splitgraph/jupyter_notebooks),
[PostGIS](../integrating_splitgraph/postgis) or [PostgREST](../splitgraph_cloud/publish_rest_api).

### What's the performance like? Do you have any benchmarks?

We maintain a couple of Jupyter notebooks with benchmarks on [our GitHub](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/v0.1.0/examples/benchmarking).

It's difficult to specify what is considered a benchmark for Splitgraph, as for a lot of operations
one would be benchmarking PostgreSQL itself. This is why we haven't run benchmarks like [TPC-DS](http://www.tpc.org/tpcds/) on Splitgraph
(since for maximum performance, it's easy to check out a Splitgraph image into a PostgreSQL schema)
but have tested the overhead of various Splitgraph workloads over PostgreSQL.

In short:

  * Committing and checking out Splitgraph images takes less time than writing the same data to PostgreSQL tables.
  * Writing to PostgreSQL tables that are change-tracked by Splitgraph is almost 2x slower
    than writing to untracked tables (Splitgraph uses audit triggers to record changes rather than
    diffing the table at commit time).
  * Splitgraph images take up much less (5x-10x) space than equivalent PostgreSQL tables due to it
    using [`cstore_fdw`](https://github.com/citusdata/cstore_fdw) for storage.
  * Querying Splitgraph images directly without checkout [(layered querying)](../large_datasets/layered_querying) can sometimes be faster and use less IO
  than querying PostgreSQL tables.

### Can Splitgraph be used for big datasets?

Yes. Splitgraph has a few optimizations that make it suitable for working with large datasets:

  * Datasets are partitioned into fragments stored in a [columnar format](../concepts/objects) which is
    superior to row-format storage for OLAP workloads.
  * Splitgraph images can be queried without checking them out [(layered querying)](../large_datasets/layered_querying) which lazily downloads a small fraction of the table needed for the query. This is still completely seamless to the client application.

### Do I have to register anywhere to use Splitgraph?

No. Splitgraph can be used in a decentralized way, sharing data between two engines like you would
with Git. Here's an [example](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/push-to-other-engine) of getting two Splitgraph instances to synchronize with each other.

You can register on [Splitgraph Cloud](../splitgraph_cloud/introduction) if you wish to
get or share public data or have a [REST API](../splitgraph_cloud/publish_rest_api) generated for your dataset.

### Why not just use...

#### dbt, Pachyderm, ...

There are plenty of great tools around for building datasets and managing ETL pipelines. Firstly,
they can also work against Splitgraph, since a Splitgraph engine is also a PostgreSQL instance.
After the dataset is built, one can snapshot the schema it was built in and package it up as a Splitgraph image.

Secondly, Splitgraph offers its own method of building datasets: [Splitfiles](../concepts/splitfiles). Splitfiles offer Dockerfile-like caching, provenance tracking, fast dataset rebuilds, joins between datasets and full SQL support.

#### dvc, DataLad, ...

Some tools use [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/) to version code and data together.
Splitgraph's versioning improves on that by delta compressing changes (which means that bringing
a dataset up to date only requires downloading the changes, rather than the new version) and putting
the data inside of an actual database, making querying it more efficient.

#### FoundationDB, Noms, ...

A lot of tools that do data versioning also require users to learn to use a brand new database
and rewrite their existing applications to use it. We don't think the benefits from writing a new
database system from scratch outweigh the costs of bringing it up to feature parity with existing
databases and bootstrapping an ecosystem of extensions and applications.

Splitgraph tries to provide an end-to-end framework for dealing with common data science problems.
Rather than taking one tool and adapting it for data, we tried to get our inspiration from multiple
best practices in software engineering.
