This section summarizes common problems and potential solutions you might encounter with Splitgraph.

## General advice

### Run Splitgraph with debug logging

For any issues, running `sgr` with `--verbosity DEBUG` will print out extra debug information and full error tracebacks
which can help you understand what's going on.

For example:

```
$ sgr --verbosity DEBUG commit demo/dataset
```

You can also add `SG_LOGLEVEL=DEBUG` to your [configuration file](../configuration/introduction) and inject it into the engine
by running [`sgr engine configure`](../sgr/engine-management/engine-configure) to make the engine write logging information in debug mode as well.

### Inspect engine logs

If you're running the engine through the `sgr engine` wrapper, you can inspect its logs by running:

```shell-session
$ sgr engine log
```

In other cases, you can inspect the logs of the container that's running the engine directly from Docker:

```shell-session
$ docker logs splitgraph_engine_default   # or other container name
```

## General issues

### Layered querying and Splitfile execution takes too long or gets stuck running SQL

It's possible that the engine is downloading objects needed to satisfy the query in the background,
which currently doesn't output the progress. Alternatively, the engine might be having some
other connection issues.

To check that, inspect the engine logs ([`sgr engine log`](../sgr/engine-management/engine-log)).

### Type "geometry" does not exist

This happens if you're trying to download a PostGIS-enabled data image with an engine that
doesn't support it. To fix this, upgrade your engine to use PostGIS:

```shell-session
$ sgr engine upgrade --image splitgraph/engine:stable-postgis
$ sgr sql "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis"
```

Then, re-clone the repository.

If there are any consistency issues (e.g. with objects still missing), you can delete the
offending repository, clean up loose objects and download it again:

```shell-session
$ sgr rm broken/repository
$ sgr cleanup
$ sgr clone broken/repository
```

### Splitgraph Engine data/metadata is taking up too much space

Check the space that's used by the engine's data (actual Splitgraph object files) and
metadata (PostgreSQL table data) by running `docker system df -v`.

You can also run [`sgr status`](../sgr/image-information/status) to list current repositories and space that they take up.

To free up some space, you can:

  * [Uncheckout](../sgr/image-management-creation/checkout) (`sgr checkout -u`) some repositories: data stored in PostgreSQL tables takes up
    more space than when stored as Splitgraph objects.
  * [Delete](../sgr/miscellaneous/rm) (`sgr rm`) unneeded repositories or images.
  * [Clean up](../sgr/miscellaneous/cleanup) (`sgr cleanup`) Splitgraph objects that are not linked to any images on your engine.
  * [Vacuum](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) the PostgreSQL instance backing the engine: `sgr sql --no-transaction "VACUUM FULL"`. This will delete dead tuples from tables that were checked out and then deleted.

Objects that were downloaded from a different engine or Splitgraph Cloud are considered to be
cached locally and can be evicted to save space. The default cache size is 10GB and can be
changed by changing the `SG_OBJECT_CACHE_SIZE` configuration flag (in MB). Eviction gets run when
objects are downloaded but you can force it by running:

```python
$ sgr eval "object_manager.run_eviction([], required_space=\\
    max(object_manager.get_cache_occupancy() - object_manager.cache_size, 0))"
```

### Waiting for connection...

`sgr` by default attempts to connect to the engine (and the registry) multiple times to
work around transient network issues or wait for engine to start up.

First, run `sgr` with `--verbosity DEBUG` to pinpoint what's causing a connection failure. Common
issues are:

  * Engine isn't started: check with `docker ps` or `sgr engine status`, then start it if needed
    with Docker or with `sgr engine start`.
  * Wrong username/password or connection parameters: check them in your `.sgconfig`:
     * `SG_ENGINE_USER`
     * `SG_ENGINE_PWD`
     * `SG_ENGINE_HOST`
     * `SG_ENGINE_PORT`

You can also check the full configuration parameters currently in use by running `sgr config`.

## Windows issues

### Password input is echoed and not accepted, other output issues

If you're running `sgr` in a MINGW terminal (for example, Git Bash), you have to [prefix its invocations with `winpty`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32597209/python-not-working-in-the-command-line-of-git-bash/32599341#32599341) to avoid output errors and make sure password inputs work properly.

The simplest way to do this is by adding `alias sgr='winpty -Xallow-non-tty sgr'` to your `.bashrc`.

The `-Xallow-non-tty` flag avoids the issue where `winpty` fails when piping data (e.g. Splitfiles)
directly to `sgr` but only works on `winpty` above 0.4.0 (check with `--version`). For older
versions of `winpty`, you'll have to run `sgr` without it when piping input to it.

### Error: input is not a TTY

This can happen if you're on Windows and are trying to pipe input to `sgr` that's run through
`winpty`. To solve this, invoke `sgr` without `winpty` or run `winpty` with `-Xallow-non-tty`

## Windows/OSX Docker issues

Windows and OSX run Docker in a virtual machine which can cause various issues when using `sgr`.

Check your Docker daemon is running:

```shell-session
$ docker info
$ docker run hello-world
```

Make sure the Docker VM is started and environment is configured:

```shell-session
$ docker-machine start
$ docker-machine env
$ eval $(docker-machine env)
```

Sometimes the IP address of the Docker VM can change, also changing the IP address of the Splitgraph
engine. To fix that, check the IP of the Docker VM:

```shell-session
$ docker-machine ip
```

Then, make sure the IP address of the engine is the same (check `SG_ENGINE_HOST` in your `.sgconfig` file).
