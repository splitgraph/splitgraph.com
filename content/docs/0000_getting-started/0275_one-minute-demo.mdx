Assuming you have a PostgreSQL client installed (like `psql`, `pgcli`, pgAdmin or DBeaver), you can start querying Splitgraph data in less than a minute.

## Connecting to the Splitgraph DDN

First, [register](https://www.splitgraph.com/auth/sign_up) on Splitgraph. We support OAuth through Google, GitHub or GitLab, as well as username/password.

Then, go to your [account settings page](https://www.splitgraph.com/settings/sql-credentials). There, you can get a username and password to connect to the [Splitgraph Data Delivery Network](../splitgraph-cloud/data-delivery-network). If you're using `psql` or `pgcli`, you can paste the connection string directly:

```shell-session
$ psql postgresql://[API_KEY]:[API_SECRET]@data.splitgraph.com:5432/ddn
```

You're now ready to run queries against Splitgraph data.

## Querying open government data

This sample query that we used in our [Metabase demo](../ingesting-data/socrata#using-metabase-to-join-and-plot-data-from-multiple-data-portals) runs a JOIN between two datasets:

```sql
SELECT
    cambridge_cases.date AS date,
    chicago_cases.cases_total AS chicago_daily_cases,
    cambridge_cases.new_positive_cases AS cambridge_daily_cases
FROM
    "cityofchicago/covid19-daily-cases-deaths-and-hospitalizations-naz8-j4nc".covid19_daily_cases_deaths_and_hospitalizations chicago_cases
FULL OUTER JOIN
    "cambridgema-gov/covid19-cumulative-cases-by-date-tdt9-vq5y".covid19_cumulative_cases_by_date cambridge_cases
ON
    date_trunc('day', chicago_cases.lab_report_date) = cambridge_cases.date
ORDER BY date ASC;
```

This will join the data between two distinct [Socrata](https://www.tylertech.com/products/socrata) open government data portals ([Chicago, IL](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Cases-and-Deaths/naz8-j4nc) and [Cambridge, MA](https://data.cambridgema.gov/Public-Safety/COVID-19-Cumulative-Cases-by-Date/tdt9-vq5y)).

## Querying geospatial data and Splitgraph images

You can also run queries against hosted Splitgraph images. If your client supports [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) (like [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) or pgAdmin), it will even plot geospatial data.

For example, you can query the [London ward boundary data](https://www.splitgraph.com/splitgraph/london_wards/) image as follows:

```sql
SELECT name, gss_code, ST_Transform(ST_SetSRID(geom, 27700), 4326)
FROM "splitgraph/london_wards".city_merged_2018
```

## Next steps

Splitgraph Cloud hosts or proxies queries to [over 40,000 datasets](/explore), letting you query them directly from your SQL client.

At the core of Splitgraph Cloud is [Splitgraph](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph) itself: a self-contained tool for building, sharing and querying data images, inspired by Docker and Git. You can [install Splitgraph](./installation) locally and go through the [five minute demo](./five-minute-demo). This will show you how to use Splitgraph to build your own data image from public data, upload it to Splitgraph Cloud and query it through the Splitgraph DDN or a REST API.

You can also use Splitgraph in a stand-alone, decentralized way without using Splitgraph Cloud. The [decentralized demo](./decentralized-demo) will show you how to spin up multiple Splitgraph instances and share data between them.
