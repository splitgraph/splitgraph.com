## Requirements

A Splitgraph installation consists of two components: [the Splitgraph engine](../architecture/splitgraph_engine) and [the Splitgraph client (`sgr`)](../architecture/sgr_client).

The client ships as a self-contained binary but can also be installed with `pip`.

To run the Splitgraph engine, you will need to be able to run [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Installation

### Single script

For Linux and OSX, there's a single script:

```
$ bash -c "$(curl -sL https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/releases/latest/download/install.sh)"
```

This script will:

  * Download the `sgr` binary from [the releases page](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/releases/latest)
  * Set up and initialize the Splitgraph Engine
  * Register you on Splitgraph Cloud (data.splitgraph.com). This is completely optional:
   Splitgraph can be used in a decentralized manner, like Git.

If you're running Windows or would like to follow the steps manually, read on.

### Manual

First, get the binary for `sgr` from [the releases page](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/releases/latest), available for the three major platforms.

Then, create a new Splitgraph engine. Do:

```
$ sgr engine add
```

This will:

  * Prompt you for a password: this is just the password used to protect your
    local engine and will be stored in the generated configuration file.
  * Pull and start the latest Splitgraph [engine](https://hub.docker.com/r/splitgraph/engine/) image
  * By default, the engine container will be named `splitgraph_engine_default` and two Docker volumes
    will be created:
    * `splitgraph_engine_default_data` to store the physical data
    * `splitgraph_engine_default_metadata` to store the metadata about composition of Splitgraph images.
  * Initialize the engine
  * Generate a minimal `.sgconfig` file for you in your home directory (`~/.splitgraph/.sgconfig`).

There are extra options in `sgr engine` for advanced users. To see them, run `sgr engine --help` or
see [the CLI reference](../sgr/engine_management/engine_add).

## Advanced installation

### `sgr`

You can also install the Splitgraph library from pip. This is useful if you want to use the
[Splitgraph Python API](../python_api/splitgraph) to manipulate images from your code:

```
$ pip install splitgraph
```

If you wish to contribute to Splitgraph itself or get the bleeding-edge version, you can follow
the [development instructions](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/#setting-up-a-development-environment)
on our GitHub.

### Engine

You can also use Docker directly to pull and start the
[engine](https://hub.docker.com/r/splitgraph/engine/):

```
$ docker run -d \\
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=supersecure \\
    -p 5432:5432 \\
    -v $PWD/splitgraph_data:/var/lib/splitgraph/objects \\
    -v $PWD/splitgraph_metadata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\
    splitgraph/engine
```

By default, `sgr` is configured to speak to the engine running on
`localhost:5432` with a superuser account called `sgr` and a password
`supersecure` against a database called `splitgraph`. The credentials used by `sgr`
can be changed by changing the [configuration file](#configuration-file).

To complete the installation, run:

```
$ sgr init
```

You can also use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). A sample
Compose configuration for the service is as follows:

```
version: '3'
services:
  engine:
    image: splitgraph/engine:${DOCKER_TAG-stable}
    ports:
      - '0.0.0.0:5432:5432'
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=sgr
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=supersecure
      - POSTGRES_DB=splitgraph
      - SG_LOGLEVEL=INFO
      - SG_CONFIG_FILE=/.sgconfig
    expose:
      - 5432
    volumes:
      - splitgraph_data:/var/lib/splitgraph/objects
      - splitgraph_metadata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ${HOME}/.splitgraph/.sgconfig:/.sgconfig
```

## Upgrading

Single-binary `sgr` can be upgraded by running [`sgr upgrade`](../sgr/miscellaneous/upgrade) which
will download the new binary and upgrade the engine (if the engine is managed by `sgr engine`).

[`sgr engine upgrade`](../sgr/miscellaneous/engine/upgrade) upgrades an engine that's managed by `sgr engine`
by deleting the current Docker container and starting a new one, keeping all data volumes intact.
Whilst the versions of `sgr` and of the engine don't need to be the same, it is recommended to match them, as the engine and `sgr` are currently tested and released in lockstep.

## Configuration file

The Splitgraph configuration file is usually stored in the user's home directory (`~/.splitgraph/.sgconfig`).

For more information on configuring Splitgraph, see [this page](../configuration/introduction).

## Next Steps

You can take a look at the [five minute demo](five_minute_demo) that will go through the basics of building
and extending data images. You can also try out some self-contained example Splitgraph projects
on [our GitHub](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples).
