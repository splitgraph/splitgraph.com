Splitgraph objects, or fragments, are building blocks of Splitgraph tables. Each object is immutable and
content-addressable (objects with same contents have the same object ID).
Multiple tables can link to a single object.

Splitgraph stores object metadata in the `splitgraph_meta.objects` table on the engine. The
metadata contains the [LTHash](https://engineering.fb.com/security/homomorphic-hashing/) of rows
added/deleted by the object and the [object index](../large-datasets/indexing)
that is a very short (a few KB) summary of the contents of the object.

With these features, Splitgraph can satisfy queries to large datasets by only downloading a few objects instead of the whole image.

Splitgraph stores object data as tables in the `splitgraph_meta` schema on the engine. Physically, objects are stored in [cstore_fdw](https://github.com/citusdata/cstore_fdw) files, a columnar store for PostgreSQL that allows for
[superior read performance and low IO load](https://tech.marksblogg.com/billion-nyc-taxi-rides-postgresql.html).
This allows Splitgraph to rapidly swap CStore fragments as flat files without the extra overhead of loading them into PostgreSQL.

Each object has an extra Boolean column, `sg_ud_flag`, that determines whether the corresponding
row in this object overwrites (upserts) or deletes a row in case of a primary key conflict.
This allows Splitgraph objects to support delta compression.

More information on [Splitgraph object internals](../working-with-data/inspecting-images#example) is available.
