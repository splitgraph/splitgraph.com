Splitgraph objects, or fragments, are building blocks of Splitgraph tables. Each object is immutable and
content-addressable (objects with same contents have the same object ID).
Multiple tables can link to a single object.

Splitgraph object metadata is stored in the `splitgraph_meta.objects` table on the engine. The
metadata contains the [LTHash](https://engineering.fb.com/security/homomorphic-hashing/) of rows
added/deleted by the object and the [object index](../large_datasets/indexing)
that is a very short (a few KB) summary of the contents of the object.

These allow Splitgraph to satisfy queries to large datasets by only downloading a few objects instead of the whole image.

Splitgraph objects are represented as tables in the `splitgraph_meta` schema on the engine. Each
object has an extra Boolean column, `sg_ud_flag`, that determines whether the corresponding
row in this object overwrites (upserts) or deletes a row in case of a primary key conflict.
This allows Splitgraph objects to support delta compression.

Physically, objects are backed by [cstore_fdw](https://github.com/citusdata/cstore_fdw) files, a
columnar store for PostgreSQL that allows for
[superior read performance and low IO load](https://tech.marksblogg.com/billion-nyc-taxi-rides-postgresql.html).
CStore fragments can be swapped in as flat files without extra overhead of loading them into PostgreSQL.

It is also possible to extend Splitgraph to use a different storage layer for fragments, storing them as normal PostgreSQL tables or using other formats like Apache ORC or Parquet.
