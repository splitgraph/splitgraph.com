A repository is a collection of Splitgraph images. The repository's name consists of two parts:
the namespace and the actual repository. For example, this:

```
splitgraph/geonames:0b77a102cbabe2de8597dcab71f1c333f16f9e1963c9c8982988e10e65989c62
```

refers to the [Geonames image](/splitgraph/geonames/0b77a102cbabe2de8597dcab71f1c333f16f9e1963c9c8982988e10e65989c62/-/overview) in the namespace `splitgraph`, repository `geonames` with image hash `0b77a102cbabe2de8597dcab71f1c333f16f9e1963c9c8982988e10e65989c62`.

By default, when you check out an image, Splitgraph loads the data into a PostgreSQL
schema with the same name as the image's repository. So if you check out the
image above, Splitgraph loads it into a PostgreSQL schema `"splitgraph/geonames"`.
Any application can then query that schema to modify the repository, and then you
can use `sgr commit` to make a new image including your changes.

In terms of access control, Splitgraph instances in "registry mode" (including
Splitgraph Cloud) use the namespace as an identifier. When you push an image to
another Splitgraph engine, you can only push it to a namespace that matches your
`session_user` (in the case of Splitgraph Cloud, this is your username).
