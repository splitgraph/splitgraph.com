Splitgraph's main purpose is to build, extend, manipulate and share data images. Data images are
essentially snapshots of a PostgreSQL schema at a given point in time, much like Docker images
are snapshots of the filesystem.

An image consists of tables. Several images can share the same table in a space-efficient
way, with the actual table data stored only once.

There are multiple ways to create Splitgraph images. Firstly, the image can be checked out
into an actual PostgreSQL schema. This enables [change tracking](../working-with-data/tracking-changes)
and allows any application that can interact with a PostgreSQL database to work with Splitgraph.
At any point in time, the schema can be committed to create a new image.

Splitgraph images can also be created using a domain-specific language called [Splitfiles](splitfiles) that offer
a similar experience to Dockerfiles, including caching to not rebuild data where sources haven't changed.

Under the hood, Splitgraph image metadata (including their parents and provenance) is stored in
`splitgraph_meta.images` table and table metadata is stored in `splitgraph_meta.tables`.
