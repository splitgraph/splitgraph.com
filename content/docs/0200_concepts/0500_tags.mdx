Tags are labels that you can add to Splitgraph images. A tag is unique per-repository.

There are two reserved tags, `latest` and `HEAD`. `latest` always points to the most recent image
in a given repository. If you have checked out at least one image in a repository, `HEAD` points
to the image you checked-out. If you have not checked out an image, or you have just created the
repository, `HEAD` points to the "empty image" (hash `0000000...`).

You can manage image tags using the [`sgr tag`](../sgr/image-management-creation/tag) command.
