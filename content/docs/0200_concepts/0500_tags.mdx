Tags are labels added to specific Splitgraph images. Tags are unique per-repository.

There are two reserved tags, `latest` and `HEAD`. `latest` always points to the most recent image
in a given repository. If the repository is currently checked out, `HEAD` points to the checked-out
image.

Image tags can be managed with [`sgr tag`](../sgr/image-management-creation/tag).
