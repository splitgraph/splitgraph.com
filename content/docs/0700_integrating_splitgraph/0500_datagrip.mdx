JetBrains DataGrip can connect to the Splitgraph engine and use it as a data source to query checked out Splitgraph tables directly or through [layered querying](../large_datasets/layered_querying).

#### Add PostgreSQL data source

#### Configure PostgreSQL database

Use a JDBC connection string to add the Splitgraph engine to DataGrip:

```
jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/splitgraph?user=sgr&password=[password]
```

#### Missing schemas

By default, DataGrip only shows the "public" schema in the selector. Splitgraph checks data images out into
schemas with the same name as the repository.

![Splitgraph schemas missing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/docs/0700_integrating_splitgraph/images/datagrip/3-schemas-missing.png)

To solve this, right click on the database, then go to Tools, Manage Shown Schemas and check "All Schemas".

![Go to Database -> Database Tools -> Manage Shown Schemas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/docs/0700_integrating_splitgraph/images/datagrip/4-solution-manage-shown-schemas.png)

![Check All Schemas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/docs/0700_integrating_splitgraph/images/datagrip/5-check-all-schemas.png)

Your checked-out Splitgraph datasets will appear in the schema selector.

#### Making geospatial queries

DataGrip has support for plotting geospatial data using [PostGIS](https://postgis.net).

Make sure you have upgraded your engine to be PostGIS-enabled:

```shell-session
$ sgr engine upgrade --image splitgraph/engine:stable-postgis
$ sgr sql "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis"
```

Clone a dataset and check it out:

```shell-session
$ sgr clone splitgraph/london_wards
$ sgr checkout --layered splitgraph/london_wards:latest
```

A good sample query is just plotting the geometry column in this dataset. This column is in the
 [British National Grid](https://epsg.io/27700) projection and we need to convert it to the standard
 [WGS 84](https://epsg.io/4326) projection in order for DataGrip to plot it with an
 [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) overlay:

```sql
SELECT name, gss_code, ST_Transform(ST_SetSRID(geom, 27700), 4326) FROM "splitgraph/london_wards".city_merged_2018
```

Toggle geo viewer by pressing gear in bottom right hand side of window.

Use mouse/keyboard to select one or multiple rows containing polygons to plot (select all with Cmd+A / Ctrl+A).
