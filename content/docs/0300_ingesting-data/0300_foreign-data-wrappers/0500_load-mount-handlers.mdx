To mount a custom database into your Splitgraph engine, you have to do three things:

- Install the foreign data wrapper into the engine (either using PGXN or compiling the wrapper by yourself)
- Write a Python class deriving from `ForeignDataWrapperDataSource` that defines the FDW's class
 and how command line options map to the FDW's own options. For an example, see `PostgreSQLDataSource` in `splitgraph.hooks.data_source`.
- Register the handler in your `.sgconfig` file:

```ini
[mount_handlers]
handler_name=your.handler.module.HandlerClass
```

Registering the handler in such a way will also use make it available in the `sgr` client as an `sgr mount` subcommand, as well as make it available to be used in Splitfiles.

For an end-to-end example of a custom mount handler querying the Firebase Hacker News API, see [Splitgraph's GitHub repository](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/custom_fdw).
