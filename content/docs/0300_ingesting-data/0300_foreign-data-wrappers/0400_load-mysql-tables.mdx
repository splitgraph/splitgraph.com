To mount a MySQL database into the Splitgraph engine using [`mysql_fdw`](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/mysql_fdw), run:

```
$ sgr mount mysql_fdw local_schema -c username:password@host:port -o@- <<EOF
{
    "dbname": "dbname",
    "tables": ["table_1"]
}
```

This will mount a MySQL schema `remote_schema` into a local schema `schema_name` on the
Splitgraph engine. Note that if your MySQL server is running on localhost and you wish to
access it over a TCP connection, you should use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` as the `host`.

`"tables"` can be omitted (in which case all tables in `remote_schema` will be mounted into `local_schema`).

You can also pass a dictionary of tables and their schema as `tables`. This will override the schema that's inferred by `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA`. For example:

```json
{
    "tables": {
        "table_1": {
            "schema": {
                "col_1": "integer",
                "col_2": "text"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To snapshot the table, making it part of an actual Splitgraph image, use the [`sgr import`](../../sgr/image-management-creation/import) command.
