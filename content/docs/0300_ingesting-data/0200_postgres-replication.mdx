It is possible to add a Splitgraph engine as a [logical replication client](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html) to a production PostgreSQL database, occasionally committing the changes as new Splitgraph images. This has many uses:

- Recording the history of the upstream database for audit purposes
- Using anonymized production data snapshots for integration testing
- Building derivative datasets with Splitfiles as an alternative to data warehousing.

For more information, see the [replication client example](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/pg-replication).
