It is possible to add a Splitgraph engine as a replication client to a production PostgreSQL database, occasionally committing the changes as new Splitgraph images. This is done through PostgreSQL logical replication and has many uses:

- Recording the history of the upstream database for audit purposes
- Using anonymized production data snapshots for integration testing
- Building derivative datasets with Splitfiles as an alternative to data warehousing.

For more information, see the [replication client example](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/pg-replication).
