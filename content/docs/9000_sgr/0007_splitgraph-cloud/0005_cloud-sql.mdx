```sgr cloud sql [OPTIONS] [QUERY]```

Run SQL on or connect to the Splitgraph Data Delivery Network.

If a query isn't passed, this will return a libpq-compatible connection string to
the registry's SQL endpoint. It can be used to connect to the endpoint with other SQL clients:

```
pgcli $(sgr cloud sql)
```

If a query is passed, this will run an SQL query against the SQL endpoint.

### Options

  * **`--remote TEXT`**: Name of the remote registry to use.
  * **`-a, --show-all`**: Return all results of the query.
  * **`-j, --json`**: Return results as JSON
