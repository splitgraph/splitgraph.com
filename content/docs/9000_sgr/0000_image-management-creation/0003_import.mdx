```sgr import [OPTIONS] IMAGE_SPEC TABLE_OR_QUERY TARGET_REPOSITORY [TARGET_TABLE]```

Import tables into a Splitgraph repository.

Imports a table or a result of a query from a local Splitgraph repository or a Postgres schema into another
Splitgraph repository.

### Examples

``sgr import noaa/climate:my_tag climate_data my/repository``

Create a new image in ``my/repository`` with the ``climate_data`` table included. This links the new image to
the physical object, meaning that the history of the ``climate_data`` table is preserved.

If no tag is specified, the 'latest' (not the HEAD image or current state of the checked out image)
image is used.

``sgr import noaa/climate:my_tag "SELECT * FROM climate_data" my/repository climate_data``

Create a new image in ``my/repository`` with the result of the query stored in the ``climate_data`` table. This
creates a new physical object without any linkage to the original data, so the history of the ``climate_data``
table isn't preserved. The SQL query can interact with multiple tables in the source image.

``sgr import other_schema other_table my/repository``

Since other_schema isn't a Splitgraph repository, this will copy ``other_schema.other_table``
into a new Splitgraph object and add the ``other_table`` table to a new image in ``my/repository``.

Note that importing doesn't discard or commit pending changes in the target Splitgraph repository: a new image
is created with the new table added, the new table is materialized in the repository and the HEAD pointer is moved.
