```sgr engine configure [OPTIONS] [NAME]```

Inject a configuration file into an engine.

This copies the current .sgconfig file (pointed to by SG_CONFIG_FILE) into
the engine container, making it use that configuration for
when it's queried through an application other than the sgr client
(layered querying).
