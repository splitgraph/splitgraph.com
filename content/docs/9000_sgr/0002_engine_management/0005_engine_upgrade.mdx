```sgr engine upgrade [OPTIONS] [NAME]```

Upgrade a Splitgraph engine.

This consists of shutting down the current Splitgraph engine,
deleting its Docker container (keeping the actual data and
metadata volumes intact), creating a container based on a newer
image and finally reinitializing the engine to perform needed migrations.

### Options

  * **`-i, --image TEXT`**: Docker image with the Splitgraph engine
  * **`--no-pull`**: Don't pull the new engine image
