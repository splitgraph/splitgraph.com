```sgr provenance [OPTIONS] IMAGE_SPEC```

Reconstruct the provenance of an image.

This inspects the image to produce a list of images that were used by the Splitfile
that created it, or a Splitfile with the same effect.

``IMAGE_SPEC`` must be of the form ``[NAMESPACE/]REPOSITORY[:HASH_OR_TAG]``.
If no tag is specified, ``latest`` is used.

### Examples

Assume ``my/repo`` is produced by the following Splitfile:

    FROM MOUNT [...] IMPORT external_table
    FROM noaa/climate IMPORT {SELECT * FROM rainfall_data WHERE state = 'AZ'} AS rainfall_data

``my/repo`` will have 2 images: one having ``hash_1`` (with the ``external_table`` imported from a mounted database)
and one having ``hash_2`` (with both ``external_table`` and the ``rainfall_data`` containing the result
of the query run against the then-latest image in the ``noaa/climate`` repository).

In this case:

``sgr provenance my/repo``

Returns a list of repositories and images that were imported by the Splitfile that constructed this image::

    my/repo:[hash_2] depends on:
    noaa/climate:[hash_3]

Where ``hash_3`` is the hash of the latest image in the ``noaa/climate`` repository at the time the original
Splitfile was run. However:

``sgr provenance -f my/repo``

Will try to reconstruct the Splitfile that can be used to build this image. Since the FROM MOUNT command isn't
reproducible (requires access to the original external database, which is a moving target), this will fail.

If ``-e`` is passed, this will emit information about irreproducible commands instead of failing.

    sgr provenance -ef my/repo

    # Splitfile commands used to reconstruct my/repo:[image_hash]
    # Irreproducible Splitfile command of type MOUNT
    FROM noaa/climate:[hash_3] IMPORT {SELECT * FROM rainfall_data WHERE state = 'AZ'}

### Options

  * **`-f, --full`**: Recreate the Splitfile used to create this image
  * **`-e, --ignore-errors`**: If set, ignore commands that aren't reproducible (like MOUNT or custom commands)
