```sgr rebuild [OPTIONS] IMAGE_SPEC```

Rebuild images against different dependencies.

Examines the provenance of a Splitgraph image created by a Splitfile and reruns it against different images than
the ones that were imported by the original run.

### Examples

``sgr rebuild my/repo --against noaa/climate:old_data``

Reconstructs the Splitfile used to create ``my/repo:latest``, replaces all imports from ``noaa/climate`` with
imports from ``noaa/climate:old_data`` and reruns the Splitfile.

``sgr rebuild my/repo:other_tag -u``

Rebuilds ``my_repo:other_tag`` against the latest versions of all of its dependencies.

Image caching still works in this case: if the result of the rebuild already exists, the image will be checked
out.

### Options

  * **`-u, --update`**: Rederive the image against the latest version of all dependencies.
  * **`-a, --against IMAGE`**: Images to substitute into the reconstructed Splitfile, of the form [NAMESPACE/]REPOSITORY[:HASH_OR_TAG]. Default tag is 'latest'.
