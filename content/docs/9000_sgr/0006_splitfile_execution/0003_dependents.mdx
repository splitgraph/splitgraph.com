```sgr dependents [OPTIONS] IMAGE_SPEC```

List images that were created from an image.

This is the inverse of the sgr provenance command. It will list all images that were
created using a Splitfile that imported data from this image.

By default, this will look at images on the local engine. The engine can be overridden
with --source-on and --dependents-on. For example:

    sgr dependents --source-on data.splitgraph.com --dependents-on LOCAL noaa/climate:latest

will show all images on the local engine that derived data from `noaa/climate:latest`
on the Splitgraph registry.

### Options

  * **`-O, --source-on TEXT`**: Override the engine to look the source up on
  * **`-o, --dependents-on TEXT`**: Override the engine to list dependents from
