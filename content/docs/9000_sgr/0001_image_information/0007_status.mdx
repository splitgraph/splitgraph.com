export const meta = {id: "status", title: "sgr status", sidebarTitle: "status", description: "Show the status of the Splitgraph engine."};

```sgr status [OPTIONS] [REPOSITORY]```

Show the status of the Splitgraph engine.

If a repository is passed, show in-depth information about a repository.

If not, show information about all repositories local to the engine. This will show a list
of all repositories, number of local images and tags, total repository size (theoretical
maximum size and current on-disk footprint of cached objects) and the current checked
out image (with LQ if the image is checked out using read-only layered querying).
