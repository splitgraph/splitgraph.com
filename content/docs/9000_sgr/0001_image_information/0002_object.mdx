Show information about a Splitgraph object.

Objects, or fragments, are building blocks of Splitgraph tables: each table consists of multiple immutable fragments
that can partially overwrite each other. Each fragment might have a parent that it depends on. In addition,
the smallest and largest values for every column are stored in the fragment's metadata. This information is used
to choose which objects to download in order to execute a query against a table.
