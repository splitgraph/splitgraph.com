```sgr diff [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY [TAG_OR_HASH_1] [TAG_OR_HASH_2]```

Show differences between two Splitgraph images.

The two images must be in the same repository. The actual targets of this command depend
on the number of arguments passed:

``sgr diff REPOSITORY``

Return the differences between the current HEAD image and the checked out schema.

``sgr diff REPOSITORY TAG_OR_HASH``

Return the differences between the image and its parent.

``sgr diff REPOSITORY TAG_OR_HASH_1 TAG_OR_HASH_2``

Return the differences from the first (earlier) image to the second image.

### Options

  * **`-v, --verbose`**: Include the actual differences rather than just the total number of updated rows.
  * **`-t, --table-name TEXT`**: Show the differences for a single table.
