export const meta = {id: "cloud-metadata", title: "sgr cloud metadata", sidebarTitle: "cloud metadata", description: "Upload a metadata file to a Splitgraph repository."};

```sgr cloud metadata [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY [METADATA_FILE]```

Upload a metadata file to a Splitgraph repository.

This can manipulate the repository's short description, README and topics.

The metadata file must be a YAML file with the keys `readme`, `description` and `topics`. Omitting a key doesn't delete the value.

For example:


```
readme: dataset-readme.md
description: Dataset description (160 characters max).
topics:
  - topic_1
  - topic_2
```
    

### Options

  * **`--remote TEXT`**: Name of the remote registry to use.
