## sgr init

```sgr init [OPTIONS] [REPOSITORY]```

Initialize a new repository/engine.

### Examples

`sgr init`

Initializes the current local Splitgraph engine by writing some bookkeeping information.
This is required for the rest of sgr to work.

`sgr init --skip-object-handling`

Initializes a Splitgraph engine without installing audit triggers or object management routines:
this is useful for engines that aren't intended to be used for image checkouts.

``sgr init new/repo``

Creates a single image with the hash ``00000...`` in ``new/repo``

### Options

  * **`--skip-object-handling`**:
