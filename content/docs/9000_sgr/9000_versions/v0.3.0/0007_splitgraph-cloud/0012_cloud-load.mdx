```sgr cloud load [OPTIONS] [LIMIT_REPOSITORIES]...```

Load a Splitgraph catalog from a YAML file.

This will load a splitgraph.yml file and the `readmes` subdirectory produced by
`sgr cloud dump` back into a remote Splitgraph catalog.

By default, if a repository doesn't yet exist, it will be public. Pass `--initial-private` to
this command to make it start off as private. This won't apply to existing repositories: use
the Splitgraph GUI to manage repository access settings.

### Options

  * **`--remote TEXT`**: Name of the remote registry to use.
  * **`--readme-dir TEXT`**: Path to the directory with the README files
  * **`-p, --initial-private`**: If the repository doesn't exist, create it as private.
  * **`-f, --repositories-file PATH`**: 
  * **`--skip-external`**: Only set up the metadata, not the external data source settings
