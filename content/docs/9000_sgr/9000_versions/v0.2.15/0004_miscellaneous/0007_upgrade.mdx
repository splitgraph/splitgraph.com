```sgr upgrade [OPTIONS] [VERSION]```

Upgrade sgr client and engine.

This will try to download the most recent stable binary for the current platform
into the location this binary is running from and then upgrade the default engine.

This method is only supported for single-binary installs and engines managed
by `sgr engine`.

### Options

  * **`--skip-engine-upgrade`**: Only upgrade the client
  * **`--path TEXT`**: Override the path to download the new binary to.
  * **`--force`**: Reinstall older/same versions.
