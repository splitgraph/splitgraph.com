```sgr push [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY_OR_IMAGE [REMOTE_REPOSITORY]```

Push images to the Splitgraph registry or another engine.

If an image is not specified (e.g. `sgr push noaa/climate`, this will push all new images.

By default, the repository will be pushed to a repository with the same name in the user's namespace
(SG_NAMESPACE configuration value which defaults to the username).

If there's a single engine registered in the config (e.g. data.splitgraph.com), it shall be the default
destination.

If an upstream repository/engine has been configured for this engine with `sgr upstream`,
it will be used instead.

Finally, if `remote_repository` or `--remote` are passed, they will take precedence.

The actual objects will be uploaded to S3 using Minio. When pushing to another engine,
you can choose to upload them directly by passing `--handler DB`.

### Options

  * **`-r, --remote []`**: Name of the remote engine
  * **`-h, --upload-handler TEXT`**: Upload handler
  * **`-o, --upload-handler-options JSON`**: Upload handler parameters
  * **`-f, --overwrite-object-meta`**: Overwrite metadata for existing remote objects
  * **`-t, --tags`**: Overwrite tags for pushed image/repo
  * **`-u, --reupload-objects`**: Reupload objects that metadata is pushed out for
