```sgr eval [OPTIONS] COMMAND```

Evaluate a Python snippet using the Splitgraph API.

This is for advanced users only and should be only used
if you know what you are doing.

Normal Python statements are supported and the command is evaluated
in a namespace where the following is already imported and available:

  * Repository: class that instantiates a Splitgraph repository and makes
    API functions like .commit(), .checkout() etc available.

  * engine: Current local engine

  * object_manager: an instance of ObjectManager that allows
    to get information about objects and manage the object cache.


Example:
```
sgr eval 'import json; print(json.dumps(Repository\
    .from_schema(repo_name)\
    .images["latest"]\
    .get_table(table_name)\
    .table_schema))' \
-a repo_name my_repo -a table_name my_table
```

Will dump the schema of table my_table in the most recent image in my_repo in JSON format.

For more information, see the Splitgraph API reference.

### Options

  * **`--i-know-what-im-doing`**: Pass this if you're sure that the code you're running is safe and don't want to be prompted.
  * **`-a, --arg <TEXT TEXT>...`**: Make extra variables available in the command's namespace
