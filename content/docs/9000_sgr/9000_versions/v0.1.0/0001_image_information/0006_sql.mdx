```sgr sql [OPTIONS] SQL```

Run an SQL statement against the Splitgraph engine.

There are no restrictions on the contents of the statement: this is the same as running it
from any other PostgreSQL client.

If ``--schema`` is specified, the statement is run with the ``search_path`` set to that schema. This means
that these statements are equivalent:

```
sgr sql "SELECT * FROM "noaa/climate".table"
sgr sql -s noaa/climate "SELECT * FROM table"
```

If `--image` is specified, this will run the statement against that image using layered querying.
Only read-only statements are supported. For example:

```
sgr sql -i noaa/climate:latest "SELECT * FROM table"
```

### Options

  * **`-r, --remote [data.splitgraph.com]`**: Perform operation on a different remote engine
  * **`-s, --schema TEXT`**: Run SQL against this schema.
  * **`-i, --image IMAGE`**: Run SQL against this image.
  * **`-a, --show-all`**: Return all results of the query.
  * **`-j, --json`**: Return results as JSON
  * **`-n, --no-transaction`**: Don't wrap the SQL in a transaction.
