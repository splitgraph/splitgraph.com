## sgr show

```sgr show [OPTIONS] IMAGE_SPEC```

Show information about a Splitgraph image. This includes its parent, comment, size and creation time.

Note that the size isn't the on-disk footprint, as the image might share some objects with other images
or if some of the image's objects have not been downloaded.

Image spec must be of the format ``[NAMESPACE/]REPOSITORY[:HASH_OR_TAG]``. If no tag is specified, ``HEAD`` is used.
