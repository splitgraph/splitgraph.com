```sgr log [OPTIONS] IMAGE_SPEC```

Show the history of a Splitgraph repository/image

By default, this shows the history of the current branch, starting from the HEAD pointer and following its
parent chain.

Alternatively, it can follow the parent chain of any other image.

If ``-t`` or ``--tree`` is passed, this instead renders the full image tree. The repository doesn't need to have
been checked out in this case.

### Options

  * **`-t, --tree`**: 
  * **`-r, --remote []`**: Perform operation on a different remote engine
