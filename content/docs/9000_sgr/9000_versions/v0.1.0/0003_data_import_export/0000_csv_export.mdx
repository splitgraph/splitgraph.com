## sgr csv export

```sgr export [OPTIONS] IMAGE_SPEC QUERY```

Export the result of a query as CSV.

### Examples

`sgr csv export noaa/climate "SELECT * FROM rainfall"`

Output everything in the currently checked-out `"rainfall"` table as CSV.

`sgr csv export noaa/climate:dec_2018 "SELECT * FROM rainfall WHERE state = 'AZ' -f dec_2018_az.csv`

Check out the `dec_2018` tag of `noaa/climate` and output values from `"rainfall"` for Arizona to `dec_2018_az.csv`

`sgr csv export --layered noaa/climate:abcdef1234567890 "SELECT * FROM rainfall JOIN other_table ON..."`

Uses layered querying instead to execute a join on tables in a certain image (satisfying the query without
having to check the image out).

### Options

  * **`-f, --file FILENAME`**: File name to export to, default stdout.
  * **`-l, --layered`**: Don't materialize the tables, use layered querying instead.
