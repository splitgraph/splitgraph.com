```sgr build [OPTIONS] SPLITFILE```

Build Splitgraph images.

This executes a Splitfile, building a new image or checking it out from cache if the same
image had already been built.

### Examples

``sgr build my.splitfile``

Executes ``my.splitfile`` and writes its output into a new repository with the same name
as the Splitfile (my) unless the name is specified in the Splitfile.

``sgr build my.splitfile -o mynew/repo``

Executes ``my.splitfile`` and writes its output into ``mynew/repo``.

``sgr build my_other.splitfile -o mynew/otherrepo --args PARAM1 VAL1 --args PARAM2 VAL2``

Executes ``my_other.splitfile`` with parameters ``PARAM1`` and ``PARAM2`` set to
``VAL1`` and  ``VAL2``, respectively.

### Options

  * **`-a, --args <TEXT TEXT>...`**: Parameters to be substituted into the Splitfile. All parameters mentioned in the file must be specified in order for the Splitfile to be executed.
  * **`-o, --output-repository REPOSITORY`**: Repository to store the result in.
