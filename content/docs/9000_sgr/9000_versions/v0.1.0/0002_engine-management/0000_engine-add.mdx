`sgr engine add [OPTIONS] [NAME]`

Create and start a Splitgraph engine.

This will pull the Splitgraph engine image, start it, create a Postgres user and initialize
the engine.

This also creates Docker volumes required to persist data/metadata.

The engine Docker container by default will be named `splitgraph_engine_default` and
its data and metadata volumes will have names `splitgraph_engine_default_data` and
`splitgraph_engine_default_metadata`.

### Options

- **`-i, --image TEXT`**: Docker image with the Splitgraph engine
- **`-p, --port INTEGER`**: Port to start the engine on
- **`-u, --username TEXT`**:
- **`--no-init`**: Don't run `sgr init` on the engine
- **`--no-sgconfig`**: Don't add the engine to .sgconfig
- **`--inject-source`**: Inject the current Splitgraph source code into the engine using Docker bind mounts
- **`--no-pull`**: Don't pull the Docker image
- **`--set-default`**: Set the engine as the default engine in the config regardless of its name
- **`--password TEXT`**:
