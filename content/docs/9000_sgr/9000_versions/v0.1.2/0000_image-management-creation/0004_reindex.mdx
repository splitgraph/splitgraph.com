```sgr reindex [OPTIONS] IMAGE_SPEC TABLE_NAME```

Run extra indexes on a table. This will merge the indexing results for all objects
that a table is formed from with the current object indexes. For explanation of
what indexes do, see the documentation for `sgr commit`.

If the objects haven't been downloaded yet, this will download them.

Currently reindexing objects that change other objects is unsupported and will raise
an error. Pass `-o` to ignore these objects and only reindex supported objects.

Image spec must be of the format ``[NAMESPACE/]REPOSITORY[:HASH_OR_TAG]``. If no tag is specified, ``HEAD`` is used.

### Options

  * **`-i, --index-options JSON`**: JSON dictionary of extra indexes to calculate, e.g. '{"bloom": {"column_1": {"probability": 0.01}}}'  [required]
  * **`-o, --ignore-patch-objects`**: Ignore objects that change other objects' rows instead of raising an error
