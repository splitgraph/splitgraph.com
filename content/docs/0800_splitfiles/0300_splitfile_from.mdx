**`FROM repository[:tag] [AS alias]`**

Bases the output of the Splitfile on a certain revision of the
remote/local repository. If `AS alias` is specified, the repository
is cloned into `alias` and the current contents of `alias`
destroyed. Otherwise, the current output repository (passed to
the executor) is used.

`FROM` can also be used to perform Docker-like multistage builds.

For example:

```
FROM internal_data:latest AS stage_1
CREATE TABLE visible_staff AS SELECT name, age FROM staff WHERE is_restricted = FALSE

FROM EMPTY AS stage_2
FROM stage_1 IMPORT {SELECT * FROM visible_staff} AS visible_staff
```
