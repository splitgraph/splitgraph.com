The Splitgraph configuration file is usually stored in the user's home directory
(`~/.splitgraph/.sgconfig`). If there's a configuration file in the current working
directory or the environment variable `SG_CONFIG_FILE` is set, that file is used instead.

It's possible to generate a configuration file with defaults by doing:

```shell-session
$ sgr config -sc > ~/.splitgraph/.sgconfig
```

Note that the `.sgconfig` file gets edited automatically by `sgr` and any values there
that are equal to their default values get deleted.

It's also possible to override various other configuration flags using environment variables. You
can inspect the current configuration in use by Splitgraph by running

```shell-session
$ sgr config
```

## In-engine configuration

Note that the Splitgraph library that's running inside the engine also needs configuration. This
is mostly required for layered querying, in which case Splitgraph inside the engine connects
to the engine itself to read object metadata and needs credentials to the remote engine in
order to download the actual objects.

It's often the case that connection parameters used by the engine to connect to itself are
different than ones used by `sgr` to connect to the engine. This happens with engines managed
by `sgr engine` that run the PostgreSQL server on port 5432 but use Docker's port forwarding
to publish the service on a different port on the host.

When the engine connects to itself, `SG_ENGINE_FDW_HOST`/`PORT` connection parameters are used.

If the engine is managed by `sgr engine`, the configuration file gets reinjected into it
by most `sgr` operations that change it, for example,
[`sgr engine add`](../sgr/engine_management/engine_add),
[`sgr cloud register`](../sgr/splitgraph_cloud/cloud_register)
or [`sgr cloud login`](../sgr/splitgraph_cloud/cloud_login). However,
if there is any out-of-band change to `.sgconfig` or issues with running layered queries,
the configuration file can be reinjected into the engine by running
 [`sgr engine configure`](../sgr/engine_management/engine_configure).

If the engine is managed manually or through Docker Compose, the configuration file can be
bind-mounted into the engine. See this example
[Compose file](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/blob/master/examples/push-to-other-engine/docker-compose.yml) for reference.

## Adding a new remote

The default section in the configuration file contains flags in use by the default Splitgraph
engine. When the engine is switched to a different global engine using the `SG_ENGINE` flag
or when Splitgraph is connecting to that engine for a push/pull, the configuration flags in that
section take precedence.

By default, Splitgraph adds a remote `data.splitgraph.com` to the configuration file when
 the client registers or logs in to [Splitgraph Cloud](../splitgraph_cloud/introduction). To add another remote,
add this to the `.sgconfig` file:

```ini
[remote: other_engine]
SG_ENGINE_ADMIN_USER=sgr
SG_ENGINE_ADMIN_PWD=supersecure
SG_ENGINE_POSTGRES_DB_NAME=splitgraph
SG_ENGINE_HOST=localhost
SG_ENGINE_PORT=5431
SG_ENGINE_USER=sgr
SG_ENGINE_PWD=supersecure
SG_ENGINE_DB_NAME=splitgraph
```

See [the engine-to-engine sync example](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/push-to-other-engine) for a setup showcasing pushing data between two Splitgraph engines.
