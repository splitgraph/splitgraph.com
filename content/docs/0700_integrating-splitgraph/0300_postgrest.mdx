Since a Splitgraph engine is also a PostgreSQL database, tools that use PostgreSQL can work with Splitgraph tables without any changes.

One such tool is [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/latest/) that generates a REST API for a PostgreSQL schema. Splitgraph runs PostgREST in [Splitgraph Cloud](../splitgraph_cloud/publish_rest_api), allowing any Splitgraph dataset to be accessed via HTTP.

You can reproduce a similar setup locally, getting PostgREST to work against a Splitgraph image.
