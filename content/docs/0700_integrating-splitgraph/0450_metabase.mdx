You can connect a [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) instance to a Splitgraph engine,
allowing you to visualize datasets that were cloned and checked out on the engine. Metabase
also works with [layered querying](../large-datasets/layered-querying), letting it query
huge datasets by only downloading a required fraction of the data.

However, there is currently an issue with Metabase Explore Data view: it doesn't support schemata with slashes in them that Splitgraph uses by default to check data out into. There's an [open GitHub issue](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/issues/12450) for this.

#### Start Metabase

Here is a sample Docker Compose service definition for Metabase running against a Splitgraph engine:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  engine:
    image: splitgraph/engine:${DOCKER_TAG-stable-postgis}
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=sgr
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=supersecure
      - POSTGRES_DB=splitgraph
      - SG_LOGLEVEL=INFO
      - SG_CONFIG_FILE=/.sgconfig
    expose:
      - 5432
    volumes:
      - ${HOME}/.splitgraph/.sgconfig:/.sgconfig
  metabase:
    image: metabase/metabase
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
```

You can also use a Splitgraph engine managed by [`sgr engine`](../sgr/engine-management/engine-add): you will have to connect it to the Docker network set up by Metabase. For example:

```shell-session
$ docker network connect metabase_default splitgraph_engine_default
```

#### Configure connection

Go to `localhost:3000` and set up your Metabase account.

![Set up Metabase account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/docs/0700_integrating-splitgraph/images/metabase/1_initial_setup.png)

Use `engine` as the database hostname if you're using the Compose file or `splitgraph_engine_default` (or the Docker container name) if you're using `sgr engine`.

#### Browse Data issue

As discussed, the "Browse Data" functionality currently doesn't work on Splitgraph, since
Splitgraph schemas contain slashes in them.

#### Write SQL

Click on "Write SQL" and select the Splitgraph database that you set up.

#### Sample datasets and queries

This sections contains some sample datasets that are hosted on Splitgraph and are ready for visualization
in Metabase.

You can use [layered querying](../large-datasets/layered-querying) to query these datasets, which
lazily downloads required fragments on the fly. For maximum performance, you can check the image
out into a real PostgreSQL table and create indexes on it (use `sgr checkout` instead of `sgr checkout --layered`)

##### Tweets of Congress

```shell-session
$ sgr clone splitgraph/congress_tweets
$ sgr checkout --layered splitgraph/congress_tweets:latest
```

```sql
SELECT DATE(time) AS date,
    COUNT(1) AS tweets
FROM "splitgraph/congress_tweets".tweets
WHERE text ILIKE '%coronavirus%'
    AND time > '2020-01-01'
GROUP BY date;
```

![Congress Tweets query example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/docs/0700_integrating-splitgraph/images/metabase/6_congress_tweets.png)

```sql
WITH hourly_counts AS (
    SELECT DATE(time) AS date,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM time) AS hour,
    COUNT(1) AS tweets
    FROM "splitgraph/congress_tweets".tweets
    GROUP BY date, hour
) SELECT hour, AVG(tweets)
    FROM hourly_counts
    GROUP BY hour;
```

    SUM(passengers) AS total_passengers
FROM "splitgraph/domestic_us_flights".flights
WHERE fly_month BETWEEN '2008-01-01' AND '2009-01-01'
GROUP BY origin_airport
ORDER BY total_passengers DESC;

##### London Wards

[London Wards image on Splitgraph](/splitgraph/london_wards)

This dataset is [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/)-enabled. Whilst Metabase doesn't support PostGIS columns directly, you can
convert them to latitude and longitude and show them using Metabase's Pin visualization.

```shell-session
$ sgr engine upgrade --image splitgraph/engine:stable-postgis
$ sgr sql "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis"
$ sgr clone splitgraph/london_wards
$ sgr checkout --layered splitgraph/london_wards:latest
```

```sql
WITH ward_centres AS (
    SELECT name, ST_Centroid(ST_Transform(ST_SetSRID(geom, 27700), 4326)) AS centroid
    FROM "splitgraph/london_wards".city_merged_2018
)
SELECT name, ST_Y(centroid) AS lat, ST_X(centroid) AS lon
FROM ward_centres;
```
