Since Splitgraph is built with Python, it offers first-class support for data science workflows that
use Python and Jupyter notebooks. You can use the Splitgraph [Python API](../python-api/splitgraph) to work with Splitgraph images. In addition, Splitgraph has direct support for exporting data into [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframes.

The [Iris example](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/iris) shows
how to use the Splitgraph Python API in a Jupyter notebook for a simple machine learning workflow.

For more information on the Python API, see the [API reference](../python-api/splitgraph.core).
