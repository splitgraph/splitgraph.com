Since the Splitgraph engine is a PostgreSQL instance, most SQL clients will be able to
connect to it and read/write to checked out Splitgraph tables without issues. You can use

```bash
sgr config -n
```

to print out a libpq connection string used by the current engine that you can paste into your
client. For example:

```bash
pgcli $(sgr config -n)
```

will run [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/) against the default engine.

Note that since Splitgraph implements [layered querying](../large-datasets/layered-querying) using
PostgreSQL foreign tables, some tools might not show them in the list of tables or show them
in a different list of foreign tables. However, in most cases, you should still be able to
query them in the same way as normal tables.
