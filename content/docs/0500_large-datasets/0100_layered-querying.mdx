Splitgraph tries to not redo work that can be done more efficiently by the database. A Splitgraph
image can be checked out into native PostgreSQL tables, allowing for necessary indexes to be created to
maximize performance for specific queries.

However, this workflow isn't suitable for exploratory queries on large datasets where checking out an image takes too long. This is why Splitgraph supports querying images directly without materializing
them into PostgreSQL tables.

This is done by so-called layered querying. Instead of PostgreSQL tables, an image is checked out
into a schema consisting of foreign tables. They still present themselves as normal tables to
any application interacting with the engine, but behind the scenes queries to them get interpreted
by the engine-side Splitgraph library. In particular, this lets Splitgraph inspect object metadata
and determine which objects need to be downloaded to satisfy the query and do so on the fly.

Layered querying takes its name from the way Docker works, where an application running inside of a container thinks that it's interacting
with a root filesystem, but is actually interacting with an OverlayFS mount that directs reads to the relevant layer.

Splitgraph uses [a fork](https://github.com/splitgraph/Multicorn)
of [Multicorn](https://multicorn.org/), an extension that allows to write foreign data wrappers
in Python. This fork has been customized so that no data actually passes through the Python runtime.
Splitgraph downloads required objects and materializes required table regions. Scans are performed
using native C code, which lets layered querying compete with and sometimes beat PostgreSQL on query performance.

Layered querying is currently read-only. The Splitfile executor uses layered querying to satisfy `IMPORT` and `SQL` commands that read from
other Splitgraph images.

## Layered checkouts

To use layered querying, check out a pulled dataset with the `--layered` flag. For example:

```shell-session
$ sgr checkout --layered splitgraph/2016_election:latest
```

You do not need to change any application that queries this schema or download any objects:
Splitgraph will do it lazily when the table is queried.

## When to use layered querying

Depending on the use case, the dataset and the query, layered querying can be faster or slower than
querying a native PostgreSQL table.

Layered querying (`sgr checkout --layered`) should work better for your use case when:

- Your queries are read-only. Layered querying doesn't support writes.
- You are querying a dataset for which you only have cloned some metadata and your query is
  only going to need a small part of the dataset. For example, if you're filtering on a single
  value for the primary key or have an equality filter on a column that has [bloom filtering](indexing)
  enabled, Splitgraph will only download a few objects to satisfy the query. You can check
  the amount of data that a query will download by running it with `EXPLAIN` first.
- You have limited disk space. `cstore_fdw` has a massive space advantage over PostgreSQL tables
  because data is organized in columns which lends itself well to compression. This also means
  that full table scans are going to be faster and have a smaller IO load in Splitgraph.

You should instead check an image out into a PostgreSQL schema (`sgr checkout`) if:

- You want to modify it.
- You want to query images that have had a lot of changes made to them. Instead of forwarding
  queries to objects directly, layered querying materializes subsets of objects that overlap
  into a temporary table, the overhead of which might be bigger than savings from scanning
  through less data. You can also consider [rechunking](chunking#rechunking-images) the image
  to make it easier to query.
- You want to extract maximum read performance from the image by using PostgreSQL indexes.
  After the image is checked out, it becomes a set of normal PostgreSQL tables that you can create
  any index on.
- You are intending to run multiple small queries against the dataset. Splitgraph's query planning
  has a considerable latency overhead over PostgreSQL's and so this kind of workload will be more
  expensive than with native PostgreSQL tables.

You can find some Jupyter notebooks with benchmarks comparing layered querying and querying native
PostgreSQL tables on [GitHub](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/benchmarking).
