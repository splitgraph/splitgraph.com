export const meta = {
  id: "metadata-vs-data",
  title: "Metadata vs data",
};

When you clone an image, or the Splitfile executor encounters one you referenced
in a Splitfile, Splitgraph only downloads the _metadata_ for the repository (or the
referenced image within the repository). The metadata consists of all Splitgraph state tables in `splitgraph_meta`:
`images`, `objects`, `tags` and `tables`. Compared to the actual data, it's very lightweight,
most of its footprint being taken up by the object index.

When you check out an image, Splitgraph downloads the actual data, which is the
set of objects required by that image. When you query a table from a [layered checkout](layered-querying),
Splitgraph only downloads objects that are required to satisfy that query, as determined by the object index.

Splitgraph considers objects downloaded from a remote engine to be "cached," and
can evict them if the free cache space is limited. You can control the cache size by the
`SG_OBJECT_CACHE_SIZE` variable in `.sgconfig`. The default value is 10240 (10GB).

With layered querying, you can see how much data a query will require before you execute it,
by running `EXPLAIN` on the query. For example, in
the [2016 US Presidential Election precinct-level returns](/splitgraph/2016_election/) dataset:

```shell-session
$ sgr sql -s splitgraph/2016_election "EXPLAIN SELECT candidate_normalized, SUM(votes) FROM precinct_results WHERE county_fips=11001 GROUP BY candidate_normalized"

GroupAggregate  (cost=71991481.18..71992900.45 rows=1 width=64)
  Group Key: candidate_normalized
  ->  Sort  (cost=71991481.18..71991954.27 rows=189234 width=380)
        Sort Key: candidate_normalized
        ->  Foreign Scan on precinct_results  (cost=20.00..71908920.00 rows=189234 width=380)
              Filter: (county_fips = 11001)
              Multicorn: Objects removed by filter: 18
              Multicorn: Scan through 2 object(s) (2.55 MiB)
JIT:
  Functions: 7
...
```

This query will need to scan (and download, if it's not already locally cached) through 2.5 MiB of data.
