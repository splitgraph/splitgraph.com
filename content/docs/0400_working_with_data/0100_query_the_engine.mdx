Splitgraph images can be checked out into schemata with the same name as the repository that
the image belongs to. For example:

```bash
$ sgr checkout example/repo_1:latest
```

will create a schema on the engine with name `example/repo_1`. This means that any application that
can access the engine via a normal database connection can interact with the checked-out repository.

`sgr` provides a shorthand, [`sgr sql`](../sgr/image_information/sql), to run arbitrary SQL queries against the engine:

```bash
$ sgr sql --schema example/repo_1 "SELECT * FROM demo"
```

However, any other SQL client will do. For example, you can use [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/) to
query and write data to the engine. In the default `sgr engine add` configuration, the connection
string is:

```bash
pgcli postgresql://sgr:password@localhost:5432/splitgraph
```

## Example

In these subsections, we'll create a couple of example repositories and
some images and then use the Splitfile language to define a reproducible
transformation on these datasets.

`sgr` comes with a few routines to set up repositories with some example data:

```shell-session
$ sgr example generate example/repo_1

Generated example/repo_1:demo with 10 rows, image hash 103cb2da2da0
```

This creates a single repository, `example/repo_1`, with a single table
in it called `demo`. The table has two columns, `key` (an integer) and
`value` (a hexadecimal string).

You can also inspect the currently checked out image in-depth:

```shell-session
$ sgr show example/repo_1:latest

Image example/repo_1:103cb2da2da000f3dce9512e3cc67434d7a3c977c0df259411c73a2687244706

Created at 2020-04-06T10:14:54.184552

Tables:
  demo
```

This image has a parent with hash `00000...`, denoting an empty image,
and one table, `demo`.

Let's take a closer look at the new table.

```shell-session
$ sgr table example/repo_1:latest demo

Table example/repo_1:103cb2da2da000f3dce9512e3cc67434d7a3c977c0df259411c73a2687244706/demo

Size: 963.00 B
Rows: 10
Columns:
  key (integer, PK)
  value (character varying)

```

This table is currently mapped to a single object.
