When a Splitgraph image is checked out into a schema, it has change tracking enabled via PostgreSQL
audit triggers. Any writes to that schema by any application will be captured, allowing Splitgraph
to package them into new images. In particular, changes to preexisting tables will be stored as
delta-compressed patches so that keeping track of table history is space efficient.

Changes to the current working checkout or between any two images in a repository can be
viewed with [`sgr diff`](../sgr/image_information/diff).

The history of all changes to an image can be viewed with [`sgr log`](../sgr/image_information/log).
This shows just the history following the parent chain of an image. However, if `-t` is passed,
this renders the whole repository as a tree.

## Example

Let's create another example repository and give the new image a tag:

```
$ sgr example generate example/repo_2
$ sgr sql --schema example/repo_2 "SELECT * FROM demo ORDER BY key"
$ sgr tag example/repo_2 original_data
```

The next step can be done from any application that can access the
PostgreSQL database backing the Splitgraph engine, but `sgr` provides a
shorthand to alter the generated image:

```
$ sgr example alter example/repo_2

Deleting 2 rows...
Updating 2 rows...
Adding 2 rows...
```

Let's inspect the current state of the repository:

```
$ sgr sql --schema example/repo_2 "SELECT * FROM demo ORDER BY key"
```

You should see that the first two rows are now missing, the second two
rows have been altered and two more rows have been added.

Let's compare the `demo` table to its previous version:

```
$ sgr diff example/repo_2 -v

Between 97900a827962 and the current working copy:
demo: added 4 rows, removed 4 rows.
