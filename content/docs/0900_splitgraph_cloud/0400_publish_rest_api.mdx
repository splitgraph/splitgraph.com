Every public dataset on the Splitgraph registry has a read-only OpenAPI-compatible endpoint that can be used to query it, provided by [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/en/latest/). It can be accessed by curl:

```
$ curl https://data.splitgraph.com/YOUR_USERNAME/votes_by_state/latest/-/rest/votes_by_state?state_postal=eq.DC

[{"candidate_normalized":"clinton","state_postal":"DC","total_votes":282830},
 {"candidate_normalized":"in","state_postal":"DC","total_votes":6551},
 {"candidate_normalized":"johnson","state_postal":"DC","total_votes":4906},
 {"candidate_normalized":"stein","state_postal":"DC","total_votes":4258},
 {"candidate_normalized":"trump","state_postal":"DC","total_votes":12723}]
```

You can also use a shorthand, `sgr cloud curl`, that takes care of all the scaffolding around
generating the URL and making sure you're logged into the registry:

```
$ sgr cloud curl YOUR_USERNAME/votes_by_state "votes_by_state?state_postal=eq.DC"

[{"candidate_normalized":"clinton","state_postal":"DC","total_votes":282830},
 {"candidate_normalized":"in","state_postal":"DC","total_votes":6551},
 {"candidate_normalized":"johnson","state_postal":"DC","total_votes":4906},
 {"candidate_normalized":"stein","state_postal":"DC","total_votes":4258},
 {"candidate_normalized":"trump","state_postal":"DC","total_votes":12723}]
```
