Most Splitgraph functionality is implemented in the `sgr` command line client that submits SQL queries
to the engine over a normal Postgres connection to manage Splitgraph metadata and perform operations
on data images.

Whilst the client is written in Python, this doesn't negatively impact Splitgraph's performance,
since the heavy lifting is done by PostgreSQL itself and almost all of Splitgraph's operations
are implemented on top of the SQL standard.

The client ships as a single Python package, [`splitgraph`](../python_api/splitgraph), which allows a user to also call
Splitgraph in Python to perform the same operations. However, it is not necessary to have a working
Python environment to use Splitgraph: the easiest way to get `sgr` is by using a single [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)
binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/releases).
