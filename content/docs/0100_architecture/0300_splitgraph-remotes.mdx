Splitgraph follows the decentralized Git model where any Splitgraph installation can act as a remote
for the purposes of pushing and pulling datasets. In essence, the local `sgr` client can communicate
with the local and the remote Splitgraph engine over the PostgreSQL wire protocol to determine
what data needs to be pushed and pulled. This works on top of the Postgres authentication where
the current role name determines which datasets a user can write to.

The [two-engine sync example](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/push-to-other-engine)
showcases setting up data sharing between two Splitgraph engines.

## Registry

The Splitgraph registry on data.splitgraph.com is a special kind of a Splitgraph remote. Clients
can communicate with it over the same (very restricted) PostgreSQL protocol to push and pull
images but can't check them out. In addition, objects are uploaded to an S3-compatible storage
instead of the registry itself.

The registry isn't required to use Splitgraph, but if you're interested in using it to share
datasets and use public datasets in Splitfiles, you can follow the [Cloud introduction](../splitgraph_cloud/introduction).
