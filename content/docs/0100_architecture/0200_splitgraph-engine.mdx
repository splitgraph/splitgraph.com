The Splitgraph Engine is where Splitgraph stores and queries datasets. It's built on top of the PostgreSQL
database with a few extensions, including the `splitgraph` Python library itself. Because of that,
you can query the Splitgraph engine with any application that works with PostgreSQL, including
[pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/), [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/) or
[PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/). You do not need to rewrite any of your
tools to use Splitgraph.

While it is possible to add Splitgraph to existing PostgreSQL deployments, there isn't currently
a simple installation method. If you're interested in doing so, you can follow the instructions
in the [engine Dockerfile](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/blob/master/engine/Dockerfile) or contact us.

The simplest way to manage the Splitgraph engine is by using [`sgr engine`](../sgr/engine-management/engine-add). `sgr engine` is a
wrapper around Docker that manages the Docker container the Splitgraph engine runs in, as well as
Docker volumes with Splitgraph data and metadata.
