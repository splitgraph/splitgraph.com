Some repositories on Splitgraph Cloud are external. This means that they aren't physically present
on the registry as images and are only indexed by us.

In most cases, we have written adapters for external repositories that make them mountable through
the Splitgraph engine by using the `sgr mount` command. This lets you query external repositories
from your engine with any PostgreSQL client and use them in Splitfiles. They are also accessible
via the [Splitgraph Cloud REST API](./publish-rest-api).

## Socrata

We index over 40000 datasets on the [Socrata open government data platform](https://www.tylertech.com/products/socrata). The [Splitgraph adapter for Socrata](../ingesting-data/socrata) is implemented as a foreign data wrapper that transforms queries
into the [SoQL query language](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/). The actual logic is executed on the Socrata server and only the
query result is sent back to the client. This means that you can explore large remote Socrata
endpoints with any PostgreSQL client, including DBeaver, Datagrip or Metabase.

Socrata repositories can be mounted as follows:

```
sgr mount socrata chicago_data \\
    --handler-options '{"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org",
                        "tables": {"fire_stations": "28km-gtjn"},
                        "app_token": "YOUR_APP_TOKEN"}'
```

Read the [Socrata documentation](../ingesting-data/socrata) for more information.
