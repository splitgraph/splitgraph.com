Some repositories on Splitgraph Cloud are external. This means that they aren't physically present
on the registry as images, and we only index them.

In most cases, we have written adapters for external repositories to make them mountable through
the Splitgraph engine by using the `sgr mount` command. This lets you query external repositories
from your engine with any PostgreSQL client and use them in Splitfiles. They are also accessible
via the [Splitgraph Cloud REST API](./publish-rest-api).

## Socrata

We index over 40000 datasets on the [Socrata open government data platform](https://www.tylertech.com/products/socrata). The [Splitgraph adapter for Socrata](../ingesting-data/socrata) is a foreign data wrapper that transforms queries
into the [SoQL query language](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/). Splitgraph forwards the query to
the Socrata server, which executes the actual logic, and then returns the query result back to the client.
This means that you can explore large remote Socrata endpoints with any PostgreSQL client, including DBeaver, Datagrip or Metabase.

You can mount Socrata repositories as follows (also see the "Mount Data" button in a Splitgraph cloud repository for templated instructions):

```
sgr mount socrata chicago_data -o @- <<EOF
{
    "domain": "data.cityofchicago.org",
    "tables": {"fire_stations": "28km-gtjn"},
    "app_token": "YOUR_APP_TOKEN"
}
EOF
```

(Note `app_token` is optional, but without it you may be throttled.)

Read the [Socrata documentation](../ingesting-data/socrata) for more information.
