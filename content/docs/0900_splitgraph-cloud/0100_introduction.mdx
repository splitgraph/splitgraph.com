Whilst you can push and pull data to/from other Splitgraph engines, using Splitgraph Cloud offers
multiple advantages over that.

Splitgraph Cloud is the analog of the Docker registry for Docker: it's a repository of
publicly available data images that you can experiment with.

Every dataset pushed out to the Splitgraph registry gets multiple perks. One of them is an automatic read-only OpenAPI-compatible endpoint that can be used to query it, provided by [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/en/latest/).

For example, [this](https://data.splitgraph.com/splitgraph/domestic_us_flights/latest/-/rest/flights?and=(origin_airport.eq.JFK,destination_airport.eq.LAX)) link runs the following PostgREST query against
the [`splitgraph/domestic_us_flights:latest`](/splitgraph/domestic_us_flights/latest/-/overview) image:

```
flights?and=(origin_airport.eq.JFK,destination_airport.eq.LAX)
```

## Register on Splitgraph Cloud

You can register and log into the registry directly from the `sgr` client:

```shell-session
$ sgr cloud register
```

This will prompt you for a username, password, e-mail, ask you to accept our Terms and Conditions
and log you into the registry.

Your API keys to communicate with the Splitgraph registry and the REST API are stored in your `.sgconfig` file.
 The only password stored in the `.sgconfig` file is the password protecting your local engine. Your
 cloud password is never stored in the config or by the registry.

To log into the registry again or get a new set of API keys, use [`sgr cloud login`](../sgr/splitgraph-cloud/cloud-login).

## Example

This Asciicast demonstrates building and pushing a dataset to Splitgraph Cloud, uploading a
README for it through the `sgr` client and using the autogenerated [REST API](./publish_rest_api).
