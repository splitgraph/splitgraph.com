You can push and pull data between any two Splitgraph engines. In the same way,
Splitgraph Cloud acts as another Splitgraph remote, but also offers multiple advantages
on top of the default sharing behavior.

Splitgraph Cloud is the analog of the Docker registry for Docker: it's a repository of
publicly available data images that you can experiment with. It also includes an index
of external data that you can mount.

Every dataset pushed to the Splitgraph registry gets multiple perks. One of them
is an autogenerated, read-only OpenAPI-compatible endpoint that you can query,
provided by [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/latest/).

For example, [this](<https://data.splitgraph.com/splitgraph/domestic_us_flights/latest/-/rest/flights?and=(origin_airport.eq.JFK,destination_airport.eq.LAX)>) link runs the following PostgREST query against
the [`splitgraph/domestic_us_flights:latest`](/splitgraph/domestic_us_flights/latest/-/overview) image:

```
flights?and=(origin_airport.eq.JFK,destination_airport.eq.LAX)
```

Note that you can run this against any version (tag) of an image, by changing the `latest` tag to a different target.

(Many more perks are coming soon!)

## Register on Splitgraph Cloud

You can register and log into the registry directly from the `sgr` client:

```shell-session
$ sgr cloud register
```

This will prompt you for a username, password, e-mail, ask you to accept our Terms and Conditions
and log you into the registry.

Splitgraph stores your API keys to communicate with the Splitgraph registry and the REST API in your `.sgconfig` file.
The only password Splitgraph stores in the `.sgconfig` file is the password protecting your local engine. It never
stores your cloud password in the config, and it never passes it to the registry, except at login time when it prompts you for it.

To log into the registry again or get a new set of API keys, use [`sgr cloud login`](../sgr/splitgraph-cloud/cloud-login).

## Example

This Asciicast demonstrates building and pushing a dataset to Splitgraph Cloud, uploading a
README for it through the `sgr` client and using the autogenerated [REST API](./publish-rest-api).
