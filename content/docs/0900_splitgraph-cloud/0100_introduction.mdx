You can push and pull data between any two Splitgraph engines. In the same way,
Splitgraph Cloud acts as another Splitgraph remote, but also offers multiple advantages
on top of the default sharing behavior.

Splitgraph Cloud is the analog of the Docker registry for Docker: it's a repository of
publicly available data images that you can experiment with. It also includes an index
of external data that you can mount.

## Feature overview

Every dataset pushed to the Splitgraph registry gets multiple perks, with more coming soon.

### REST API

Splitgraph Cloud uses [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/latest/) to provide an autogenerated read-only OpenAPI-compatible [REST endpoint](publish-rest-api) for all datasets, including [for external repositories](external-repositories).

For example, [this](<https://data.splitgraph.com/splitgraph/domestic_us_flights/latest/-/rest/flights?and=(origin_airport.eq.JFK,destination_airport.eq.LAX)>) link runs the following PostgREST query against
the [`splitgraph/domestic_us_flights:latest`](/splitgraph/domestic_us_flights/latest/-/overview) image:

```
flights?and=(origin_airport.eq.JFK,destination_airport.eq.LAX)
```

Note that you can run this against any version (tag) of an image, by changing the `latest` tag to a different target.

### Data Delivery Network

The [Data Delivery Network](data-delivery-network) is a single SQL endpoint that you can connect to with most PostgreSQL clients and BI tools. It allows you to query Splitgraph datasets without having to install any extra software and is the simplest way to interact with data hosted or proxied by Splitgraph.

In the future, we will be adding more features to the DDN, like caching, advanced access control and ability to add custom data sources.

### Data catalog

The [catalog](https://www.splitgraph.com/explore) lets you discover Splitgraph datasets. It already hosts over 40,000 Splitgraph repositories, consisting of versioned Splitgraph images and [external repositories](external-repositories) that you can query with SQL via Splitgraph.

The catalog also has a provenance view for data images built with [Splitfiles](../concepts/splitfiles), which lets you discover how an image was built, which other images it referenced and which images referenced it.

## Register on Splitgraph Cloud

You can register and log into the registry directly from the `sgr` client:

```shell-session
$ sgr cloud register
```

This will prompt you for a username, password, e-mail, ask you to accept our Terms and Conditions
and log you into the registry.

Splitgraph stores your API keys to communicate with the Splitgraph registry and the REST API in your `.sgconfig` file.
The only password Splitgraph stores in the `.sgconfig` file is the password protecting your local engine. It never
stores your cloud password in the config, and it never passes it to the registry, except at login time when it prompts you for it.

To log into the registry again or get a new set of API keys, use [`sgr cloud login`](../sgr/splitgraph-cloud/cloud-login).

## `sgr cloud` commands

If you're logged into Splitgraph Cloud, you get access to some commands that you can use to interact with Splitgraph directly from your shell:

  * [`sgr cloud search`](../sgr/splitgraph-cloud/cloud-search): [search](https://www.splitgraph.com/search) for Splitgraph data repositories
  * [`sgr cloud sql`](../sgr/splitgraph-cloud/cloud-sql): query Splitgraph's [SQL endpoint (Data Delivery Network)](data-delivery-network)
  * [`sgr cloud curl`](../sgr/splitgraph-cloud/cloud-curl): query Splitgraph's [REST endpoint](publish-rest-api)
  * [`sgr cloud readme/description/metadata`](../sgr/splitgraph-cloud/cloud-readme): upload metadata for Splitgraph datasets

## Example

This Asciicast demonstrates building and pushing a dataset to Splitgraph Cloud, uploading a
README for it through the `sgr` client and using the autogenerated [REST API](./publish-rest-api).
