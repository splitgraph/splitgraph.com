It is possible to add a Splitgraph engine as a replication client to a production PostgreSQL database, occasionally committing the changes as new Splitgraph images. This is done through PostgreSQL logical replication and has many uses:

  * Recording the history of the upstream database for audit purposes
  * Using anonymized production data snapshots for integration testing
  * Building derivative datasets with Splitfiles as an alternative to data warehousing.
