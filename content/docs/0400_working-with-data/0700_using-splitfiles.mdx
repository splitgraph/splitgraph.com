Whilst you can create new images using `sgr commit`, there is a better
way: Splitfiles. Splitfiles are a declarative way to define new datasets
inspired by Dockerfiles. The same ideas hold here: every command defines
a new image with a deterministic hash (a combination of the hash of the
previous image and the specifics of the command). If the hash that's
about to be produced by a command already exists, the image is checked
out instead, avoiding the actual data transformation.

This means that you can not only easily produce derivative datasets, but
also keep them up to date without extra effort.

For more information on the available Splitfile commands, see the [Splitfile command reference](../splitfiles/splitfile-intro).

## Example

In this demo, we'll run an SQL JOIN query on the two repositories that
we produced to match up the keys from the first table with the keys from
the second table.

`sgr` comes with a generator for this example Splitfile:

```shell-session
$ sgr example splitfile example/repo_1 example/repo_2 | tee example.splitfile

# Import the table from the latest image in the first repository
FROM example/repo_1 IMPORT demo AS table_1

# Import the table from a certain image (passed in as a parameter) in the second repository
FROM example/repo_2:${IMAGE_2} IMPORT demo AS table_2

# Create a join table
SQL {
    CREATE TABLE result AS
        SELECT table_1.key, table_1.value AS value_1,
            table_2.value AS value_2
        FROM table_1 JOIN table_2
        ON table_1.key = table_2.key
    }
```

This file consists of three commands:

- Import the first `demo` table into the new image and call it
  `table_1`. One thing to note is that importing doesn't actually
  consume extra space in the image, since it just links the image to
  the original object representing the first `demo` table. Since we
  didn't specify an explicit image or tag, the latest image in
  `example/repo_1` will be used.
- Do the same with the `example/repo_2` repository, but this time
  use a parameter `IMAGE_2` for the image. This parameter will have
  to be substituted in at Splitfile execution time to define the
  exact image we will want to use.
- Finally, run an SQL statement against the newly built image with
  the two imported tables. In this case, we will create a new table
  (called `result`) and put the results of the JOIN query in it.

Let's run this Splitfile using the original data in the `example/repo_2`
repository:

```shell-session
$ sgr build example.splitfile -o example/output --args IMAGE_2 original_data

Executing Splitfile example.splitfile with arguments {'IMAGE_2': 'original_data'}

Step 1/3 : FROM example/repo_1 IMPORT demo AS table_1

If you have seen the output of a Dockerfile being executed, this will
also look familiar to you. Let's inspect the repository that we've just
created:

```shell-session
$ sgr log example/output

Tables:
  result
  table_1
  table_2
```

Let's also look at the actual data we produced. Since we ran the
Splitfile against the original version of the `example/repo_2`
repository, all keys from 0 to 9 should be present in the join table:

```shell-session
$ sgr sql --schema example/output "SELECT * FROM result ORDER BY key"

```

Finally, since each image at execution time has a deterministic hash,
rerunning the same Splitfile won't actually perform any computation:

```shell-session
$ sgr build example.splitfile -o example/output --args IMAGE_2 original_data

Executing Splitfile example.splitfile with arguments {'IMAGE_2': 'original_data'}

Step 3/3 : SQL CREATE TABLE result AS SELECT table_1.key, table_1.va...

## Sample Splitfiles

### RDU weather data

This is a self-contained example that doesn't pull datasets from Splitgraph: it uses the
RDU weather dataset from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/local-weather-archive) and demonstrates building and rebuilding Splitfiles.

[RDU Splitfile example](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/splitfile)

### 2016 US Election

This example uses a Splitfile to build a dataset that joins several datasets together:

- US Census demographic data ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data/download))
- Census tracts designated as Qualified Opportunity Zones ([source](https://www.cdfifund.gov/Documents/Designated%20QOZs.12.14.18.xlsx))
- 2016 US Presidential Election precinct-level returns ([source](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/LYWX3D))

It then runs a quick linear regression against the resultant dataset to see if there is a
correlation between the voting patterns in a given county and the fraction of QOZ-qualified
Census tracts in that county.

### Other Splitfiles

There are multiple loose Splitfiles that can be run against various datasets in Splitgraph Cloud on
[GitHub](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/tree/master/examples/sample_splitfiles).
