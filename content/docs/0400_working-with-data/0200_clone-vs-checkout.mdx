You can clone a Splitgraph repository using the [`sgr clone`](../sgr/sharing-images/clone) command:

```shell-session
$ sgr clone some_namespace/some_repository
```

This will look for this repository in all currently registered remotes in `SG_REPO_LOOKUP` and
clone the repository from the first remote that contains it.

By default, cloning a Splitgraph repository is different than what happens with Git repositories.
In this case, Splitgraph only clones the repository's _metadata_, which is lightweight compared to the
actual data but still lets the user get an overview of the repository.

For example, consider the [2016 US Presidential Election precinct-level returns](/splitgraph/2016_election/) dataset:

```shell-session
# This only transfers a few KB of metadata.
$ sgr clone splitgraph/2016_election

Gathering remote metadata...
Fetched metadata for 1 image, 1 table, 20 objects and 1 tag.

# How big is the actual image?
$ sgr show splitgraph/2016_election:latest
Image splitgraph/2016_election:3835145ada3f07cad99087d1b1071122d58c48783cbfe4694c101d35651fba90

Created at 2019-10-10T15:51:41.122370
Size: 26.75 MiB
No parent (root image)

  precinct_results
```

Splitgraph tries to be as lazy as possible and only download the actual data when a query or a
checkout requires it. You can override this behavior by passing `--download-all` to `sgr clone`.

## Checkout

On checkout of an image, Splitgraph gathers all objects required by that image, downloads them
and assembles them into tables in a process called "materialization".

```shell-session
$ sgr checkout splitgraph/2016_election:latest

Need to download 20 objects (26.75 MiB), cache occupancy: 492.69 MiB/10.00 GiB
