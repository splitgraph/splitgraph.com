Image metadata can be inspected using the [`sgr show`](../sgr/image-information/show) command:

```bash
$ sgr show namespace/repository:image_hash
```

Tables in a given image can be inspected using the [`sgr table`](../sgr/image-information/table) command:

```bash
$ sgr table namespace/repository:image_hash table_name
```

Finally, object metadata can be inspected with [`sgr object`](../sgr/image-information/object):

```bash
$ sgr object object_id
```

These commands require the repository (but not its actual data) to be cloned. It's also possible
to inspect the metadata on a remote repository without cloning any images by passing the
`-r` or `--remote` flag to these commands:

```bash
$ sgr show -r data.splitgraph.com splitgraph/geonames:latest
Image splitgraph/geonames:0b77a102cbabe2de8597dcab71f1c333f16f9e1963c9c8982988e10e65989c62

## Example

Let's further inspect the object that the first example image, `example/repo_1`, used.

```bash
$ sgr object o26c6d8345cba276f807d7bcf906531568f309c2609a3420d98c01a6c99b166

```

There are a few interesting things in this object's metadata. Firstly, it's stored in the `FRAG` format.
A Splitgraph table consists of multiple fragments that can partially overwrite each other.

Every fragment also has a column index: this is a metadata entry showing, for every column, the minimum
and maximum values that this fragment affects (deletes or inserts). This is used when querying large remote
Splitgraph tables to not download fragments that definitely don't match a given query. For qualifiers on sorted
columns (like the primary key), this can mean only downloading one or two fragments to satisfy a query to a table
composed of hundreds.

Finally, every fragment also has an insertion and a deletion hash: the insertion hash is the hash of all the rows
that this fragment inserts and the deletion hash is the hash of all the rows that this fragment deletes. These hashes
are homomorphic (every row is hashed individually and then the hashes are summed up) and are similar to Facebook's
[LtHash](https://code.fb.com/security/homomorphic-hashing/). They have a really important property: the sum of all
hashes of individual fragments composing a table is equal to the content hash of a whole table. This is used in
deduplicating data and optimizing storage.

The object ID is deterministic and is generated by combining the content hash (insertion - deletion hash) and the
hash of the schema of a given object. This means that Splitgraph fragments are content-addressable.

Now, let's look at the second object that the new version of the `demo` table in `example/repo_2:new_data` is linked to.

```shell-session
$ sgr object o4882c12cdc4cb5b4e89481ebdb71585998633f19a72652debbb80980ae0f0b

Object ID: o4882c12cdc4cb5b4e89481ebdb71585998633f19a72652debbb80980ae0f0b

Location: created locally
```

As you can see, this new object is based on the object that was used by the very first version
of the data we generated (`o4882c12cdc4cb5b4e89481ebdb71585998633f19a72652debbb80980ae0f0b`). This
is because the demo data is static and so the first version of the `demo` table in `example/repo_1` and
`example/repo_2` is in fact the same.

Since this object updates and deletes some rows, their values are included in its deletion hash, which is now non-zero.

Finally, the column index now spans all the values of the `key` column that were replaced or added. Hence, when there's
a query against this table that is inside that range, both fragments will be fetched to check if they match
that query.

We can also inspect the actual object: every object in the Splitgraph cache is stored as a
[CStore](https://github.com/citusdata/cstore_fdw) columnar storage file.

```shell-session
$ sgr sql "SELECT * FROM splitgraph_meta.o4882c12cdc4cb5b4e89481ebdb71585998633f19a72652debbb80980ae0f0b"

3       4e07408562bedb8b60ce05c1decfe3ad16b72230967de01f640b7e4729b49fce_UPDATED        True

0       None    False
1       None    False
```

The object is stored with the same schema as the original table, plus a Boolean flag showing whether a row has been
updated/inserted (upserted) or deleted. For deleted rows, only the primary key is recorded and the rest of the table
is padded with `NULL`s.

Splitgraph objects aren't always stored in the engine: when an image is pushed to an external location,
they are usually uploaded to an S3-compatible storage.
